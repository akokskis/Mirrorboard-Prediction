Prologue


	He sat there alone enclosed
	Outside were the stars and one particular star with its small system of worlds He could see it in his minds eye more clearly than he would see it in reality if he merely deopacified the window
	A small star pinkishred the color of blood and destruction and named appropriately
	Nemesis
	Nemesis the Goddess of Divine Retribution
	He thought again of the story he had once heard when he was younga legend a myth a tale of a worldwide Deluge that wiped out a sinful degenerate humanity leaving one family with which to start anew
	No flood this time Just Nemesis 
	The degeneration of humanity had returned and the Nemesis that would be visited upon it was an appropriate judgment It would not be a Deluge Nothing as simple as a Deluge
	Even for the remnant who might escapeWhere would they go Why was it he felt no sorrow Humanity could not continue as it was It was dying slowly through its own misdeeds If it exchanged a slow excruciating death for a much faster one was that a cause for sorrow
	Here actually circling Nemesis a planet Circling the planet a satellite Circling the satellite Rotor
	That ancient Deluge carried a few to safety in an Ark He had only the vaguest idea of what the Ark was but Rotor was its equivalent It carried a sampling of humanity who would remain safe and from which a new and far better world would be built
	But for the old worldthere would be only Nemesis
	He thought of it again A red dwarf star moving on its inexorable path Itself and its worlds were safe Not so Earth
	Nemesis was on its way Earth 
	Wreaking its Divine Retribution


One Marlene


	Marlene had last seen the Solar System when she was a little over one year old She didnt remember it of course
	She had read a great deal about it but none of the reading had ever made her feel that it could ever have been part of her nor she a part of it
	In all her fifteen years of life she remembered only Rotor She had always thought of it as a large world It was eight kilometers across after all Every once in a while since she was tenonce a month when she could manage itshe had walked around it for the exercise and sometimes had taken the lowgravity paths so she could skim a little That was always fun Skim or walk Rotor went on and on with its buildings its parks its farms and mostly its people
	It took her a whole day to do it but her mother didnt mind She said Rotor was perfectly safe Not like Earth she would say but she wouldnt say why Earth was not safe Never mind she would say
	It was the people Marlene liked least The new census they said would show sixty thousand of them on Rotor Too many Far too many Everyone of them showing a false face Marlene hated seeing those false faces and knowing there was something different inside Nor could she say anything about it She had tried sometimes when she had been younger but her mother had grown angry and told her she must never say things like that
	As she got older she could see the falseness more clearly but it bothered her less She had learned to take it for granted and spend as much time as possible with herself and her own thoughts
	Lately her thoughts were often on Erythro the planet they had been orbiting almost all her life She didnt know why these thoughts were coming to her but she would skim to the observation deck at odd hours and just stare at the planet hungrily wanting to be thereright there on Erythro
	Her mother would ask her impatiently why she should want to be on an empty barren planet but she never had an answer for that She didnt know I just want to she would say
	She was watching it now alone on the observation deck Rotorians hardly ever came here They had seen it all Marlene guessed and for some reason they didnt have her interest in Erythro
	There it was partly in light partly dark She had a dim memory of being held to watch it swim into view seeing it every once in a while always larger as Rotor slowly approached all those years ago
	Was it a real memory After all she had been getting on toward four then so it might be
	But now that memoryreal or notwas overlaid by other thoughts by an increasing realization of just how large a planet was Erythro was over twelve thousand kilometers across not eight kilometers She couldnt grasp that size It didnt look that large on the screen and she couldnt imagine standing on it and seeing for hundredsor even thousandsof kilometers But she knew she wanted to Very much
	Aurinel wasnt interested in Erythro which was disappointing He said he had other things to think of like getting ready for college He was seventeen and a half Marlene was only just past fifteen That didnt make much difference she thought rebelliously since girls developed more quickly
	At least they should She looked down at herself and thought with her usual dismay and disappointment that somehow she still looked like a kid short and stubby
	She looked at Erythro again large and beautiful and softly red where it was lit It was large enough to be a planet but actually she knew it was a satellite It circled Megas and it was Megas much larger still that was really the planet even though everyone called Erythro by that name The two of them together Megas and Erythro and Rotor too circled the star Nemesis
	Marlene Marlene heard the voice behind her and knew that it was Aurinel She had grown increasingly tonguetied with him of late and the reason for it embarrassed her She loved the way he pronounced her name He pronounced it correctly Three syllablesMarLAYnuhwith a little trill to the r It warmed her just to hear it
	She turned and mumbled Hi Aurinel and tried not to turn red He grinned at her Youre staring at Erythro arent you 
	She didnt answer that Of course thats what she would be doing Everyone knew how she felt about Erythro How come youre here Tell me you were looking for me she thought
	Aurinel said Your mother sent me Oh well Why
	She said you were in a bad mood and every time you felt sorry for yourself you came up here and I was to come and get you because she said it would just make you grumpier to stay here So why are you in a bad mood
	Im not And if I am I have reasons
	What reasons Come on now Youre not a little kid any more Youve got to be able to express yourself
	Marlene lifted her eyebrows I am quite articulate thank you My reasons are that I would like to travel
	Aurinel laughed Youve traveled Marlene Youve traveled more than two lightyears No one in the whole history of the Solar System has ever traveled even a small fraction of a lightyear Except us So you have no right to complain Youre Marlene Insigna Fisher Galactic Traveler
	Marlene suppressed a giggle Insigna was her mothers maiden name and whenever Aurinel said her three names in full he would salute and make a face and he hadnt done that in a long time She guessed it was because he was getting close to being a grownup and he had to practice being dignified
	She said I cant remember that trip at all You know I cant and not being able to remember it means it doesnt matter Were just here over two lightyears from the Solar System and were never going back
	How do you know
	Come on Aurinel Do you ever hear anyone talk about going back
	Well even if we dont who cares Earth is a crowded world and the whole Solar System was getting crowded and used up Were better off out heremasters of all we survey
	No were not We survey Erythro but we dont go down there to be its masters
	Sure we do We have a fine working Dome on Erythro You know that
	Not for us Just for some scientists Im talking about us They dont let us go down there
	In time said Aurinel cheerfully
	Sure when Im an old woman Or dead
	Things arent that bad Anyway come on out of here and into the world and make your mother happy I cant stay here I have things to do Dolorette
	Marlene felt a buzzing in her ears and she didnt hear exactly what Aurinel said after that It was enough to hearDolorette
	Marlene hated Dolorette who was tall andand vacuous 
	But what was the use Aurinel had been hanging around her and Marlene knew just by looking at him exactly how he felt about Dolorette And now he had been sent to find her and he was just wasting his time She could tell that was how he felt and she could also tell how anxious he was to get back to thatto that Dolorette Why could she always tell It was so hateful sometimes
	Quite suddenly Marlene wanted to hurt him to find words to give him pain True words though She wouldnt lie to him She said Were never going back to the Solar System I know why not
	Oh whys that When Marlene hesitating said nothing he added Mysteries
	Marlene was caught She was not supposed to say this She mumbled I dont want to say Im not supposed to know But she did want to say At the moment she wanted everyone to feel bad
	But youll tell me Were friends arent we
	Are we Marlene asked She said Okay III tell you Were not ever going back because Earth is going to be destroyed
	Aurinel didnt react as she had expected He burst into a loud squawk of a laugh It took him a while to settle down and she glared at him indignantly
	Marlene he said where did you hear that Youve been viewing thrillers
	I have not 
	But what makes you say anything like that
	Because I know I can tell From what people say but dont say and what they do when they dont know theyre doing it And from things the computer tells me when I ask the right questions
	Like what things it tells you
	Im not going to tell you 
	Isnt it possible Just barely possibleand he held up two fingers very closely togetherthat youre imagining things
	No it isnt possible Earth wont be destroyed right awaymaybe not for thousands of yearsbut its going to be destroyed She nodded solemnly her face intense And nothing can stop it
	Marlene turned and walked away angry at Aurinel for doubting her No not doubting her It was more than that He thought she was out of her mind And there it was She had said too much and had gained nothing by it Everything was wrong
	Aurinel was staring after her The laughter had ceased on his boyishly handsome face and a certain uneasiness was creasing the skin between his eyebrows
	Eugenia Insigna had grown middleaged during the trip to Nemesis and in the course of the long stay after arrival Over the years she had periodically warned herself This is for life and for our childrens lives into the unseen future
	The thought always weighed her down
	Why She had known this as the inevitable consequence of what they had done from the moment Rotor had left the Solar System Everyone on Rotorvolunteers allhad known it Those who had not had the heart for eternal separation had left Rotor before takeoff and among those who had left was
	Eugenia did not finish that thought It often came and she tried never to finish it
	Now they were here on Rotor but was Rotor home It was home for Marlene she had never known anything else But for herself for Eugenia Home was Earth and Moon and Sun and Mars and all the worlds that had accompanied humanity through its history and prehistory They had accompanied life as long as there had been life The thought that home was not here on Rotor clung to her even now
	But then she had spent the first twentyeight years of her life in the Solar System and she had done graduate work on Earth itself in her twentyfirst to twentythird years
	Odd how the thought of Earth periodically came to her and lingered She hadnt liked Earth She hadnt liked its crowds its poor organization its combination of anarchy in the important things and governmental force in the little things She hadnt liked its assaults of bad weather its scars over the land its wasteful ocean She had returned to Rotor with an overwhelming gratitude and with a new husband to whom she had tried to sell her dear little turning worldto make its orderly comfort as pleasant to him as it was to her who had been born into it
	But he had only been conscious of its smallness You run out of it in six months he had said
	She herself hadnt held his interest for much longer than that Oh well
	It would work itself out Not for her Eugenia Insigna was lost forever between worlds But for the children Eugenia had been born to Rotor and could live without Earth Marlene had been bornor almost bornto Rotor alone and could live without the Solar System except for the vague feeling that she had originated there Her children would not know even that and would not care To them Earth and the Solar System would be a matter of myth and Erythro would have become a rapidly developing world
	She hoped so Marlene had this odd fixation on Erythro already though it had only developed in the last few months and might leave just as quickly as it had come
	Altogether it would be the height of ingratitude to complain No one could possibly have imagined a habitable world in orbit about Nemesis The conditions that created habitability were remarkable Estimate those probabilities and throw in the nearness of Nemesis to the Solar System and you would have to deny that it could possibly have happened
	She turned to the days reports which the computer was waiting with the infinite patience of its tribe to give her
	Yet before she could ask her receptionist signaled and a soft voice came from the small buttonspeaker pinned to the left shoulder of her garment Aurinel Pampas wishes to see you He has no appointment
	Insigna grimaced then remembered that she had sent him after Marlene She said Let him come in
	She cast a quick look at the mirror She could see that her appearance was reasonable To herself she seemed to look younger than her fortytwo years She hoped she looked the same way to others
	It seemed silly to worry about her appearance because a seventeenyearold boy was about to enter but Eugenia Insigna had seen poor Marlene looking at that boy and she knew what that look portended It didnt seem to Insigna that Aurinel who was so fond of his own appearance would ever think of Marlene who had never been able to rid herself of her childhood pudginess in any way other than as an amusing child Still if Marlene had to face failure in this let her not feel that her mother had contributed to that failure in any way and had been anything but charming to the boy
	Shell blame me anyway thought Insigna with a sigh as the boy walked in with a smile that had not yet outgrown its adolescent shyness
	Well Aurinel she said Did you find Marlene
	Yes maam Right where you said shed be and I told her you wanted her out of there 
	And how is she feeling
	If you want to know Dr InsignaI cant tell if its depression or something else but she has a rather funny idea in her head I dont know that shed like my telling you about it
	Well I dont like setting spies on her either but she frequently has strange ideas and she worries me Please tell me what she said
	Aurinel shook his head  All right but dont tell her I said anything This one is really crazy She said that Earth was going to be destroyed
	He waited for Insigna to laugh She did not Instead she exploded What What made her say that
	I dont know Dr Insigna Shes a very bright kid you know but she gets these funny ideas Or she may have been putting me on
	Insigna cut in She may have been doing exactly that She has a strange sense of humor So listen I dont want you to repeat this to anyone else I dont want silly stories to get started Do you understand
	Certainly maam
	Im serious Not a word Aurinel nodded briskly
	But thanks for telling me Aurinel It was important to do so Ill speak to Marlene and find out whats bothering herand I wont let her know you told me
	Thank you said Aurinel But just one thing maam
	Whats that
	Is Earth going to be destroyed
	Insigna stared at him then forced a laugh Of course not You may go now
	Insigna looked after him and wished earnestly that she could have managed a more convincing denial
	Janus Pitt made an impressive appearance which had helped him in his rise to power as Commissioner of Rotor In the early days of the formation of the Settlements there had been a push for people of no more than average height There had been thoughts of having a smaller per capita requirement for room and resources Eventually the caution had been deemed unnecessary and had been abandoned but the bias was still there in the genes of the early Settlements and the average Rotorian remained a centimeter or two shorter than the average citizens of later Settlements
	Pitt was tall though with iron gray hair and a long face and deep blue eyes and a body that was still in good shape despite the fact that he was fiftysix
	Pitt looked up and smiled as Eugenia Insigna entered but felt the usual small surge of uneasiness There was something always uneasymaking about Eugenia even wearying She had these Causes capital C that were hard to deal with
	Thank you for seeing me Janus she said on such short notice
	Pitt placed his computer on hold and leaned back in his chair deliberately producing an air of relaxation
	Come he said theres no formality between us We go back a long way
	And have shared a great deal said Insigna
	So we have said Pitt  And how is your daughter
	Its about her I wish to speak as a matter of fact Are we shielded
	Pitts eyebrows arched Why shielded What is there to shield and from whom
	The very question activated Pitts realization of the odd position in which Rotor found itself To all practical purposes it was alone in the Universe The Solar System was more than two lightyears away and no other intelligencebearing worlds might exist within hundreds of lightyears or for all anyone knew billions of lightyears in any direction
	Rotorians might have fits of loneliness and uncertainty but they were free of any fear of outside interference Well almost any fear thought Pitt
	Insigna said You know what there is to shield It was you who have always insisted on secrecy
	Pitt activated the shield and said  Are we to take that up again Please Eugenia its all settled It was settled when we left fourteen years ago I know that you brood about it now and then
	Brood about it Why not Its my star and her arm flailed outward as if in the direction of Nemesis Its my responsibility
	Pitts jaw tightened Do we have to go through all this again he thought
	Aloud he said Were shielded Now whats bothering you
	Marlene My daughter Somehow she knows
	Knows what
	About Nemesis and the Solar System
	How could she know Unless youve told her
	Insigna spread her arms helplessly Of course I didnt tell her but I dont have to I dont know how it is but somehow Marlene seems to hear and see everything And from the little things she hears and sees she works things out Shes always been able to do it but in the last year its grown much worse
	Well then she guesses and sometimes she makes lucky guesses Tell her shes wrong and see that she doesnt talk about it
	But shes already told a young man who came to tell me Thats how I know Aurinel Pampas Hes a friend of the family
	Ah yes Im aware of himsomewhat Simply tell him not to listen to fantasies made up by a little girl
	Shes not a little girl Shes fifteen
	To him shes a little girl I assure you I said Im aware of the young man Im under the impression hes pushing adulthood very hard and I remember when I was his age that fifteenyearold girls were beneath contempt especially if they were
	Insigna said bitterly I understand Especially if they are short plump and plain Does it matter that shes highly intelligent
	To you and to me Certainly To Aurinel certainly not If necessary Ill talk to the boy You talk to Marlene Tell her the idea is ridiculous that it isnt true and that she must not spread disturbing fairy tales
	But what if it is true
	Thats beside the point Look Eugenia you and I have concealed this possibility for years and it would be better if we continued to conceal it If it gets around it will be exaggerated and there will be rising sentiment about the matteruseless sentiment It will only distract us from the job that has occupied our time ever since we left the Solar System and which will continue to occupy us for generations perhaps
	She looked at himshocked unbelieving Have you really no feeling for the Solar System for Earth the world on which humanity originated
	Yes Eugenia I have all sorts of feelings But theyre visceral and I cant let them sway me We left the Solar System because we thought it was time for humanity to spread outward Others Im sure will follow maybe they are already doing so We have made humanity a Galactic phenomenon and we mustnt think in terms of a single planetary system any more Our job is here 
	They stared at each other then Eugenia said with a touch of hopelessness Youll talk me down again Youve talked me down for so many years
	Yes but next year Ill have to again and the year after You wont stay down Eugenia and you tire me The first time should have been enough And he turned away back to his computer


Two Nemesis


	The first time he had talked her down had been sixteen years ago in the year  that exciting year in which the possibilities of the Galaxy had opened up for them
	Janus Pitts hair was a dark brown then and he was not yet Commissioner of Rotor though everyone spoke of him as the upandcoming man He did head the Department of Exploration and Commerce however and the Far Probe was his responsibility and to a large extent the result of his actions
	It was the first attempt to push matter through space with a hyperassisted drive
	As far as was known only Rotor had developed hyperassistance and Pitt had been the strongest proponent of secrecy
	He had said at a meeting of the Council The Solar System is crowded There are more space Settlements than can easily be found room for Even the asteroid belt is only an amelioration It will be uncomfortably crowded soon enough Whats more each Settlement has its own ecological balance and we are drifting apart in that respect Commerce is being throttled for fear of picking up someone elses strains of parasites or pathogens
	The only solution fellow Councillors is to leave the Solar Systemwithout fanfare without warning Let us leave and find a new home where we can build a new world with our own brand of humanity our own society our own way of life This cant be done without hyperassistancewhich we have Other Settlements will eventually learn the technique and will leave too The Solar System will be a dandelion gone to seed its various components drifting in space
	But if we go first we will find a world perhaps before others follow We can establish ourselves firmly so that when others do follow and perhaps come across us in our new world we will be strong enough to send them elsewhere The Galaxy is large and there are bound to be elsewheres
	There had been objections of course and fierce ones There were those who argued out of fearfear of leaving the familiar There were those who argued out of sentimentsentiment for the planet of birth There were those who argued out of idealismthe desire to spread knowledge so that others might go too
	Pitt had scarcely thought he would win out He had done so because Eugenia Insigna had supplied the winning argument What an incredible stroke of luck it was that she had come to him first
	She was quite young then only twentysix married but not yet pregnant She was excited flushed and laden down with computer sheets
	Pitt had frowned he recalled at her intrusion He was Secretary of the Department and shewell she was nobody although as it happened this was the very last moment when she would be nobody
	At the time he didnt realize this of course and he was annoyed that she had forced her way in He cringed at the obvious excitement of the young woman She was going to make him go through the infinite complexities of whatever it was she was holding in her hand and do so with an enthusiasm that would quickly exhaust him
	She should give a brief summary to one of his assistants He decided to say so I see you have data there Dr Insigna that you wish to bring to my attention Ill be glad to look at it in due course Why dont you leave it with one of my people And he indicated the door hoping ardently that she would aboutface and move in that direction Sometimes in idle moments in later years he would wonder what would have happened if she had and his blood would run cold at the thought
	But she said No no Mr Secretary I must see you and no one else Her voice trembled as she spoke as though her inner excitement was unbearable Its the greatest discovery anyone has made sincesince She gave up Its the greatest 
	Pitt looked dubiously at the sheets she was holding They were quivering but he felt no answering excitement of his own These specialists always thought some microadvance in their microfield was systemshattering
	He said resigned Well Doctor can you explain it simply
	Are we shielded sir
	Why do we have to be shielded
	I dont want anyone else to hear till Im suresure I have to check again and recheck till theres no doubt But really I have no doubt Im not making sense am I
	No youre not said Pitt coldly placing his hand on a contact Were shielded Now tell me
	Its all here Ill show it to you
	 No First tell me In words Briefly 
	She drew a deep breath Mr Secretary Ive discovered the nearest star Her eyes were wide and she was breathing rapidly
	Pitt said The nearest star is Alpha Centauri and thats been known for four centuries
	Its the nearest star weve known but it isnt the nearest we can know I have discovered one that is closer The Sun has a distant companion Can you believe it
	Pitt considered her carefully It was rather typical If they were young enough enthusiastic enough inexperienced enough they would explode prematurely every time
	He said  Are you sure
	I am Really Let me show you the data Its the most exciting thing that has happened in astronomy since
	If its happened And dont show me the data Ill look at it later Tell me If theres a star much closer than Alpha Centauri why hasnt it been discovered before now Why was it left to you to do so Dr Insigna He knew he was sounding sarcastic but she didnt seem to pay attention to his tone She was far too excited
	Theres a reason Its behind a cloud a dark cloud a puff of dust that just happens to be between the companion star and ourselves Without the absorption of the dust it would be an eighthmagnitude star and it would certainly have been noticed The dust cuts down the light and makes it nineteenthmagnitude lost among many millions of other faint stars There was no reason to notice it No one looked at it Its in Earths far southern sky so that most of the telescopes in preSettlement days couldnt even point in that direction
	And if so how is it youve noticed it
	Because of the Far Probe You see this Neighbor Star and the Sun are changing positions relative to each other of course I assume it and the Sun are revolving about a mutual center of gravity very slowly in a period of millions of years Some centuries ago the positions may have been such that we could have seen the Neighbor Star to one side of the cloud in its full brightness but we would still have needed a telescope to see it and telescopes are only six centuries oldless old than that in those places on Earth from which the Neighbor Star would be visible Some centuries from now it will be seen clearly again shining from the other side of the dust cloud But we dont have to wait for centuries The Far Probe did it for us
	Pitt could feel himself igniting a distant core of warmth arising within him He said Do you mean that the Far Probe took a picture of that section of the sky containing this Neighbor Star and that the Far Probe was far enough out in space to see around the cloud and detect the Neighbor Star at full brightness
	Exactly We had an eighthmagnitude star where no eighthmagnitude star ought to be and the spectrum was that of a red dwarf You cant see red dwarf stars far away so it had to be pretty close
	Yes but why closer than Alpha Centauri
	Naturally I studied the same area of the sky as seen from Rotor and the eighthmagnitude star wasnt there However fairly near it was a nineteenthmagnitude star that wasnt present in the photograph taken by the Far Probe I assumed that the nineteenthmagnitude star was the eighthmagnitude star obscured and the fact that they werent exactly in the same place had to be the result of parallactic displacement
	Yes I understand about that A nearby objects appears to be in different places against the distant background as one views it from different spots
	Thats right but the stars are so distant that even if the Far Probe went out a big fraction of a lightyear that change in position wouldnt produce a noticeable shift in distant stars but it would in nearby stars And for this Neighbor Star it produced a huge shift I mean comparatively I checked the sky for different positions of the Far Probe on its journey outward There were three photographs taken during those intervals when it was in normal space and the Neighbor Star was progressively brighter as the Probe viewed it farther and farther toward the edge of the cloud From the parallactic displacement the Neighbor Star turns out to be at a distance of just over two lightyears Its at half the distance of Alpha Centauri
	Pitt looked at her thoughtfully and in the long silence that followed she grew restless and uncertain
	Secretary Pitt she said do you want to see the data now
	No he said Im satisfied with what youve told me Now I must ask you some questions It seems to me if I understand you correctly that the chance that someone would concentrate on a nineteenthmagnitude star and try to get its parallax and determine its distance is negligible
	Just about zero
	Is there any other way of noticing that an obscure star must be very near to us
	It may have a large proper motionfor a star I mean that if you watch it steadily its own motion would change its place in the sky in a more or less straight line 
	Would that be noticed in this case
	It might be but not all stars have a large proper motion even if they are close to us They are moving in three dimensions and we see the proper motion only in a twodimensional projection I can explain
	No Im continuing to take your word for it Has this star got a large proper motion
	That would take some time to determine I do have a few older pictures of that part of the sky and I could detect an appreciable proper motion That would need more work
	But do you think it has the kind of proper motion that would force itself on astronomers if they just happened by accident to note the star
	No I dont
	Then is it possible that we on Rotor are the only ones who know about this Neighbor Star since were the only ones whove sent out a Far Probe This is your field Dr Insigna Do you agree that were the only ones whove sent out a Far Probe
	The Far Probe isnt entirely a secret project Mr Secretary Weve accepted experiments from the other Settlements and discussed that part of it with everyone even Earth which isnt too interested in astronomy these days
	Yes they leave it to the Settlements which is sensible But have any other Settlements sent out a Far Probe that they have kept secret
	I doubt that very much sir They would need hyperassistance for that and we have kept the technique of hyperassistance entirely secret If they had hyperassistance wed know Theyd have to perform experiments in space that would give the fact away
	According to the Open Science Agreement all data obtained by the Far Probe is to be published generally Does that mean that you have already informed
	Insigna interrupted indignantly Of course not I would have to find out a good deal more before I publish What I have now is only a preliminary result that Im telling you in confidence
	But you are not the only astronomer working on the Far Probe I presume youve shown the results to the others
	Insigna flushed and looked away Then she said defensively No I havent I noticed this datum I followed it up I worked out its significance I And I want to make sure I get the credit for it There is only one star that is nearest to the Sun and I want to be in the annals of science as its discoverer
	There might be a still closer one and now Pitt permitted himself the first smile of the interview
	It would have been long known Even my star would be known but for the very unusual existence of that tiny obscuring cloud To have anotherand closerstar is quite out of the question
	Then it boils down to this Dr Insigna You and I are the only ones to know of the Neighbor Star Am I right No one else
	Yes sir Just you and I so far
	Not just so far It must remain a secret to us until I am prepared to tell certain specific others
	But the agreementthe Open Science Agreement
	Must be ignored There are always exceptions to everything Your discovery involves Settlement security If Settlement security is involved we are not required to make the discovery an open one We dont make hyperassistance open do we
	But the existence of the Neighbor Star has nothing to do with Settlement security
	On the contrary Dr Insigna it does Perhaps you dont realize it but you have come upon something that can change the destiny of the human species
	She stood there frozen staring at him
	Sit down We are conspirators you and I and we must be friendly From now on you are Eugenia to me when were alone and I am Janus to you
	Insigna demurred I dont think thats proper
	It will have to be Eugenia We cant conspire on frigid formal terms
	But I dont want to conspire with anyone about anything and thats all there is to it And I dont see the point about keeping secret the facts concerning the Neighbor Star
	I suppose you are afraid of losing the credit
	Insigna hesitated the merest moment then said You can bet your last computer chip I am Janus I want my credit
	For the moment he said forget that the Neighbor Star exists You know that Ive been arguing for quite a while that Rotor ought to leave the Solar System Where do you stand on that Would you like to leave the Solar System
	She shrugged Im not sure It would be nice to see some astronomical object close up for the first timebut its a little frightening too isnt it
	You mean leaving home
	Yes
	But you wouldnt be leaving home This is home Rotor His arm flipped from side to side It would come with you
	Even so Mr SecJanus Rotor isnt all there is to home We have a neighborhood the other Settlements the planet Earth the whole Solar System
	Its a crowded neighborhood Eventually some of us will have to go whether we want to or not On Earth there was once a time when some people had to cross mountain ranges and oceans Two centuries ago people on Earth had to leave their planet for Settlements This is just another step forward in a very old story
	I understand but there are some people who never went There are people who are still on Earth There are people whove lived in one small region of Earth for countless generations
	And you want to be one of these nonmovers
	I think my husband Crile does Hes quite outspoken about your views Janus
	Well we have freedom of speech and thought on Rotor so he can disagree with me if he pleases Now heres something else Id like to ask you When people generally on Rotor or elsewhere think of moving away from the Solar System where do they think of going
	Alpha Centauri of course Its the star everyone believes is closest Even with hyperassistance we cant end up going faster than the speed of light on the average so it would take us four years Anywhere else it would take much longer and four years is long enough to travel
	Suppose it were possible to travel even faster and suppose you could reach much farther than Alpha Centauri where would you go then
	Insigna paused in thought awhile then said I supposestill Alpha Centauri It would still be in the old neighborhood The stars at night would still seem quite the same That would give us a comfortable feeling We would be closer to home if we wanted to return Besides Alpha Centauri A which is the largest of the threestar Alpha Centauri system is practically a twin of the Sun Alpha Centauri B is smaller but not too small Even if you ignore Alpha Centauri C a red dwarf you would still have two stars for the price of one so to speak two sets of planets
	Suppose a Settlement has left for Alpha Centauri and found decent habitability there and settled down to build a new world and back in the Solar System it was known that this had happened Where would the next Settlements go once they decided to leave the Solar System
	To Alpha Centauri of course said Insigna without hesitation So the human species would tend to go to the obvious place and if one Settlement succeeds others would follow quickly until the new world was as crowded as the old until there were many people with many cultures and eventually many Settlements with many ecologies
	Then it will be time to move on to other stars
	But always Eugenia success in one place will draw other Settlements A salubrious star a good planet will bring others flocking
	I suppose so
	But if we go to a star that is only a little over two lightyears away only half the distance of Alpha Centauri and no one knows about it except us who will follow us
	No one until they find out about the Neighbor Star
	But that might take a long time For that long time they would all flock to Alpha Centauri or to any of a few other obvious choices They would never notice a red dwarf star at their doorstep or if they did notice it they would dismiss it as unfit for human lifeif they didnt know that human beings had already made it a going concern
	Insigna stared at Pitt uncertainly But what does all this mean Suppose we go to the Neighbor Star and no one knows about it What is the advantage
	The advantage is that we can fill the world If there is a habitable planet
	There wont be Not around a red dwarf star
	Then we can use whatever raw material that exists there to build any number of Settlements
	You mean there would be more room for us
	Yes Much more room than if they came flocking in after us
	So we would have a little more time Janus Eventually we would fill the room available for us at the Neighbor Star even if we were alone So it would take us five hundred years instead of two hundred What difference would that make
	All the difference you can imagine Eugenia Let the Settlements crowd in as they wish and we will have a thousand different cultures bringing with them all the hatreds and misfittings of Earths dismal history Give us time to be here alone and we can build a system of Settlements that will be uniform in culture and ecology It will be a far better situationless chaotic less anarchic
	Less interesting Less variegated Less alive
	Not at all Well diversify Im sure The different Settlements will have their differences but there will at least be a common base from which those differences will spring It will be a far better group of Settlements for that And even if I am wrong surely you see that its an experiment that must be tried Why not devote one star to such a reasoned development and see if it works We can take one star a red dwarf throwaway that no one would be ordinarily interested in and use it to see if we can build a new kind of society and possibly a better one
	Let us see what we can do he went on if we dont have our energies worn out and broken by useless cultural differences and our overall biology constantly perverted by alien ecological inroads
	Insigna felt herself moved Even if it didnt work humanity would have learned somethingthat this wouldnt work And if it did work
	But then she shook her head Its a useless dream The Neighbor Star will be independently discovered no matter how we try to keep it secret
	But how much of your own discovery Eugenia was accidental Be truthful now You just happened to notice the star You just happened to compare it with what you could see on another map Might you not have missed it altogether And might not others have missed it under similar circumstances
	Insigna did not answer but the expression on her face was satisfactory to Pitt
	His voice had grown softer almost hypnotic  And if there is a delay of only a hundred years If we are given only a hundred years to ourselves to build our new society we would be large enough and strong enough to protect ourselves and make the others pass by and go on to other worlds We wont have to hide any longer than that
	Again Insigna did not answer Pitt said Have I convinced you She seemed to shake herself Not entirely
	Then think about it and Ill ask you just one favor While you think about it dont say a word to anyone about the Neighbor Star and let me have all the data in connection with it for safekeeping I wont destroy it My promise We will need it if we are going to go to the Neighbor Star Will you go that far at least Eugenia
	Yes she said at last in a small voice Then she fired up One thing though I must be able to name the star If I give it a name then its my star
	Pitt smiled briefly What do you want to call it Insignas Star Eugenias Star
	No Im not that foolish I want to call it Nemesis
	Nemesis NEMESIS
	Yes
	But why
	There was a brief period of speculation back in the late twentieth century about the possibility of a Neighbor Star for the Sun It came to nothing at that time No Neighbor Star was found but it had been referred to as Nemesis in the papers devoted to it I would like to honor those daring thinkers
	Nemesis Wasnt there a Greek goddess of that name An unpleasant one
	The Goddess of Retribution of Justified Revenge of Punishment It entered the language as a rather flowery word The computer called it archaic when I checked
	And why would those oldtimers have called it Nemesis
	Something to do with the cometary cloud Apparently Nemesis
	in its revolution about the Sun passed through the cloud and induced cosmic strikes that killed off large portions of Earth life every twentysix million years
	Pitt looked astonished Really
	No not really The suggestion didnt survive but I want Nemesis to be the name just the same And I want it to go on record that I named it
	I promise you that Eugenia Its your discovery and that will enter our records Eventually when the rest of humanity discovers the Nemesian regionwould that be the right way of putting itthey will then learn who made the discovery and how it came about Your star your Nemesis will be the first star other than the Sun itself to shine over a human civilization and the first without exception to shine over a human civilization that originated elsewhere
	Pitt watched her leave and felt on the whole confident She would fall in line His letting her name the star was the perfect touch Surely she would want to go to her own star Surely she would feel the attraction of building a logical and orderly civilization about her star one from which civilizations all over the Galaxy might descend
	And then just as he might have relaxed in the glow of a golden future he was shaken by a faint touch of horror that was utterly alien to him
	Why Nemesis Why should it have occurred to her to name it for the Goddess of Retribution
	He was almost weak enough to think of it as an evil omen


Three Mother


	It was dinnertime and Insigna was in one of those moods when she was just a little afraid of her own daughter
	Those moods had become more pronounced lately and she didnt know why Perhaps it was Marlenes increasing tendency to silence to being withdrawn to be always seeming to commune with thoughts too deep for speech
	And sometimes the uneasy fear in Insigna was mixed with guilt guilt because of her lack of motherly patience with the girl guilt because of her toogreat awareness of the girls physical shortcomings Marlene certainly didnt have her mothers conventional prettiness or her fathers wildly unconventional good looks
	Marlene was short andblunt That was the only word that Insigna could find that exactly fit poor Marlene
	And poor of course It was the adjective she almost always used in her own mind and could just barely keep out of her speech
	Short Blunt Thick without being fat that was Marlene Nothing graceful about her Her hair was dark brown rather long and quite straight Her nose was a little bulbous her mouth turned down just a bit at the ends her chin small her whole attitude passive and turned in upon itself
	There were her eyes of course large and lustrously dark with meticulous dark eyebrows that curved above them long eyelashes that looked almost artificial Still eyes alone could not make up for everything else however fascinating they might be at odd moments
	Insigna had known since Marlene was five that she was unlikely ever to attract a man on the physical plane alone and that had become more obvious with each year
	Aurinel had kept a languid eye on her during her preteen years obviously attracted to her precocious intelligence and her almost luminous understanding And Marlene had been shy and pleased in his presence as though dimly realizing that there was something about an object called a boy that was somehow endearing but not knowing what it might be
	In the last couple of years it seemed to Insigna that Marlene had finally clarified in her mind what boy meant Her omnivorous reading of books and viewing of films too old for her body if not her mind undoubtedly helped her in this but Aurinel had grown older too and as his hormones began to exert their sway over him it was no longer badinage he was in search of
	At dinner that night Insigna asked What kind of day did you have dear
	A quiet one Aurinel came looking for me and I suppose he reported to you Im sorry you have to take the trouble to hunt me down
	Insigna sighed But Marlene I cant help but think sometimes that youre unhappy and isnt it natural for me to be concerned about that Youre alone too much
	I like to be alone
	You dont act it You show no signs of happiness at being alone There are many people who would like to be friendly and you would be happier if you allowed them to be Aurinel is your friend
	Was Hes all busy these days with other people Today that was obvious It infuriated me Imagine him getting all wrapped up because he was thinking about Dolorette
	Insigna said You cant quite blame Aurinel you know Dolorette is his age
	Physically said Marlene What a bubblehead
	Physically counts a great deal at his age
	He shows it It makes a bubble head out of him too The more he slobbers over Dolorette the emptier his head gets I can tell
	But hell keep on getting older Marlene and when hes a little older he might find out what the really important things are And youll be getting older too you know
	Marlene stared at Insigna quizzically Then she said Come on Mother You dont believe what youre trying to imply You dont believe it for a minute
	Insigna flushed It suddenly occurred to her that Marlene wasnt guessing She knewbut how did she know Insigna had made her remark as sincerely as she could had tried to feel it But Marlene had seen through it without effort It wasnt the first time either Insigna had begun to feel that Marlene weighed the inflections the hesitations the motions and always knew what you didnt want her to know It must be this quality that made Insigna increasingly frightened of Marlene You dont want to be glass to anothers scornful glance
	What had Insigna said for instance that had led Marlene to believe the Earth was doomed to destruction That would have to be taken up and discussed
	Insigna suddenly felt tired If she couldnt ever fool Marlene why try She said Well lets get down to it dear What is it you want
	Marlene said I see you really want to know so III tell you I want to get away
	Get away Insigna found herself unable to understand the simple words her daughter had used Where is there to get away to
	Rotor isnt all there is Mother
	Of course not But its all there is within more than two lightyears
	No Mother thats not so Less than two thousand kilometers away is Erythro
	That scarcely counts You cant live there
	There are people living there
	Yes but under a Dome A group of scientists and engineers live there because they are doing necessary scientific work The Dome is much smaller than Rotor If you feel cramped here what will you feel there
	Theres a whole world on Erythro outside the Dome Someday people will spread out and live allover the planet
	Maybe Its by no means a certain thing
	Im sure it is a certain thing
	Even if it is it would take centuries
	But it has to begin Why cant I be part of the beginning
	Marlene youre being ridiculous Youve got a very comfortable
	home here When did all this start
	Marlene pressed her lips together then said Im not sure A few months ago but its getting worse I just cant stand it here on Rotor
	Insigna looked at her daughter frowning She thought She feels she has lost Aurinel she is heartbroken forever she will leave and punish him by doing so She will send herself into exile on a barren world and he will be sorry
	Yes that line of thought was entirely possible She remembered when she herself was fifteen Hearts are so fragile then that a slight tap will crack them Teenagers heal quickly but no fifteenyearold would or could believe that at the time Fifteen It is later later that
	No use thinking about it
	She said What is it that attracts you about Erythro Marlene
	Im not sure Its a large world Isnt it natural to want a large worldshe hesitated before adding the last two words but she gulped them out somehow like Earth
	Like Earth Insigna spoke with vehemence Youve never been on Earth You dont know anything about Earth
	Ive seen a great deal about it Mother The libraries are full of films about Earth
	Yes they were Pitt had felt for some time now that such films ought to be sequesteredor even destroyed He maintained that to break away from the Solar System meant to break away it was wrong to maintain an artificial romanticism about Earth Insigna had disagreed strongly but now she suddenly thought that she could see Pitts point
	She said Marlene you cant go by those films They idealize things They talk about the long past for the most part when things on Earth were better and even so it was never as good as they picture things to have been
	Even so
	No not even so Do you know what Earth is like Its an unlivable slum Theys why people have left it to form all the Settlements People went from the large dreadful world of Earth to small civilized Settlements No one wants to go in the other direction
	There are billions of people who still live on Earth
	Thats what makes it an unlivable slum Those who are there leave as soon as they can Thats why so many Settlements have been built and are so crowded Thats why we left the Solar System for here darling
	Marlene said in a lower voice Father was an Earthman He didnt leave Earth even though he might have
	No he didnt He stayed behind She frowned trying to keep her voice level
	Why Mother
	Come Marlene Weve talked about this Many people stayed home They didnt want to leave a familiar place Almost every family on Rotor had stayonEarths You know that very well Do you want to return to Earth Is that it
	No Mother Not at all
	Even if you wanted to go youre over two lightyears away and you cant go Surely you understand that
	Of course I understand that I was just trying to point out that we have another Earth right here Its Erythro Thats where I want to go thats where I long to go
	Insigna couldnt stop herself It was almost with horror that she heard herself say So you want to break away from me as your father did
	Marlene flinched then recovered She said Is it really true Mother that he broke away from you Perhaps things might have been different if you had behaved differently Then she added quietly just as though she were announcing that she was done with dinner You drove him away didnt you Mother


Four Father


	Oddor perhaps stupidthat she was still capable of hurting herself unbearably with thoughts of that kind after fourteen years
	Crile was  meters tall where on Rotor the average height for men was a bit under  meters That alone as in the case of Janus Pitt gave him a commanding aura of strength that persisted well after the time when she came to recognize without ever quite admitting it to herself that she could not rely on his strength
	He had a craggy face too a prominent nose and cheekbones a strong china look somehow of hunger and wildness Everything about him spoke of strong masculinity She could almost smell it when she met him and was struck with fascination at once
	Insigna was still a graduate student in astronomy at the time completing her stint on Earth looking forward to returning to Rotor so that she could qualify for work on the Far Probe She dreamed of the wide advances the Far Probe would make possible and never dreamed that she herself would make the most astonishing one
	And then she met Crile and found herself to her own confusion madly in love with an Earthmanan Earthman Overnight she felt herself abandoning the Far Probe in her mind becoming ready to remain on Earth just to be with him
	She could still remember the way he had looked at her in astonishment and said Remain here with me Id rather come to Rotor with you She could not have imagined that he would want to abandon his world for her 
	How Crile managed to obtain permission to come to Rotor Insigna did not know and had never found out
	The immigration rules were strict after all Once any Settlement had a sizable population it clamped down on immigrationfirst because it could not exceed a certain definite limit on the number of people it could support comfortably and second because it made a desperate effort to keep its ecological balance stable People who came on important business from Earthor even from other Settlementshad to undergo tedious decontamination procedures a certain degree of isolation and an enforced departure as soon as possible
	Yet here was Crile from Earth He complained to her once of the weeks of waiting that had been part of the decontamination and she was secretly pleased at the way he had persisted Clearly he must have wanted her very badly to submit to it
	Yet there were times when he seemed withdrawn and inattentive and she would wonder then what had really driven him to Rotor over such obstacles Perhaps it was not she but the need to escape Earth that had been the motivating force Had he committed a crime Made a murderous enemy Fled a woman he had grown tired of She had never dared ask
	And he had never offered information Even after he had been allowed to enter Rotor there was a question as to how long he might be able to remain The Bureau of Immigration would have to grant a special permit to make him a full citizen of Rotor and that was not ordinarily likely
	Insigna had found all the things that made Crile Fisher unacceptable to Rotorians additional inducements for fascination She found that his being Earthborn lent him a difference and a glamour True Rotorians would be bound to despise him as an aliencitizen or notbut she found even that a source of erotic excitement She would fight for him and triumph against a hostile world
	When he tried to find some sort of work that would enable him to earn money and occupy a niche in the new society it was she who pointed out to him that if he married a Rotorian womanRotorian for three generationsthat would be a powerful inducement for the Bureau of Immigration to grant him full citizenship
	Crile seemed surprised at that as though it hadnt occurred to him and then pleased Insigna had found it a little disappointing It would be much more flattering to be married for the sake of love than for the sake of citizenship but then she thought to herself Well if thats what it takes
	So after a typical long Rotorian engagement they were married Life went on without much change He was not a passionate lover but he had not been that before the marriage either He had offered her an absent affection an occasional warmth that kept her constantly near happiness if not altogether immersed in it He was never actively cruel and unkind and he had given up his world for her and gone through considerable inconvenience to be with her Surely that might be counted in his favor and Insigna counted it so
	Even as a full citizen which he had been granted after their marriage there remained a kernel of dissatisfaction within him Insigna was aware of this and could not entirely blame him He might be a full citizen yet he was still not a nativeborn Rotorian and many of the most interesting activities on Rotor were closed to him She did not know what his training had been for he never mentioned how much of an education he had had He didnt sound uneducated and there was no disgrace in being selfeducated but Insigna knew that on Earth the population did not take higher education as a given the way that Settlement populations did
	The thought bothered her She didnt mind Crile Fisher being an Earthman and facing down her friends and colleagues where that was concerned She didnt know though if she could quite handle his being an uneducated Earthman
	But no one ever suggested he was and he listened to the tales of her work on the Far Probe with patience She never tested his education by discussing the technical details of course Yet sometimes he asked questions or made comments that reflected on such things and she valued them when they came for she always managed to convince herself that they were intelligent questions and comments
	Fisher had a job on one of the farms a perfectly respectable job even an essential one but a job that was not high on the social scale He did not complain or make a fuss about thatshed give him thatbut he never talked about it or showed any pleasure in it And there was always that air of discontent about him
	Insigna learned therefore to attempt no cheery  And what happened to you at work today Crile
	The few times she had asked just at first the answer had been a flat Nothing much And that would be all except for a short annoyed look
	Eventually she grew nervous about talking to him even of petty office politics and annoying errors That too might serve as an unwelcome comparison of her work with his
	Insigna had to admit that her fears went against the evidence there an example of her own insecurity rather than his Fisher didnt show signs of impatience when she did find herself forced to discuss the days work Sometimes he even asked with a pallid interest about hyperassistance but Insigna knew little or nothing about that
	He was interested in Rotorian politics and showed an Earthmans impatience with the smallness of its concerns She fought with herself not to show displeasure at that
	Eventually there fell a silence between them broken only by indifferent discussions concerning the films they had viewed the social engagements they undertook the small change of life
	It didnt lead to active unhappiness Cake had quickly changed to white bread but there were worse things than white bread
	It even had a small advantage Working under tight security meant talking to no one about ones work but how many managed to whisper partial confidences to wife or husband Insigna had not done so for she had little in the way of temptation since her own work required little in the way of security
	But when her discovery of the Neighbor Star was suddenly placed under tight wraps without warning could she have managed Surely it would have been the natural thing to doto tell her husband of the great discovery that was bound to put her name into the astronomy texts for as long as humanity existed She might have told him even before she told Pitt She might have come bouncing in Guess what Guess what Youll never guess
	But she hadnt It didnt occur to her that Fisher would be interested He might talk to others about their work even to farmers or sheetmetal workers but not to her
	So it was no effort to mention nothing to him of Nemesis The matter was dead between them was not missed did not exist until that dreadful day when their marriage came to an end
	When did she move over wholeheartedly to Pitts side
	At the start Insigna had been horrified at the thought of keeping the Neighbor Star a secret profoundly uneasy at the prospect of moving away out of the Solar System to a destination concerning which they knew nothing but the location She found it ethically wrong and indecently dishonorable to set about building a new civilization by stealth one which excluded all the rest of humanity
	She had given in on the grounds of Settlement security but she had intended to fight Pitt privately to bring up points of argument She had rehearsed them in her own mind till they were foolproof and irrefutable and then somehow she never presented them
	Alwaysalwayshe took the initiative
	Pitt said to her early on Now remember Eugenia you discovered the companion star more or less by accident and one of your colleagues may do so as well
	Its not likely she began
	No Eugenia were not going to depend on unlikelihood Were going to make certain Youre going to see to it that no one looks in that direction that no one wants to study the particular computer sheets that would give away the location of Nemesis
	How can I possibly do that
	Very easily I have spoken to the Commissioner and as of now you are in complete charge of the Far Probe research
	But that would mean Ive been moved over the head
	Yes It means an advance in responsibility in pay in social stature To which of these do you object
	I dont object to any of this said Insigna her heart beginning to pound
	Im sure you can fulfill the job of Chief Astronomer more than adequately but your chief aim will be to see to it that the work done can be of the highest possible quality and significance provided that what is done has nothing to do with Nemesis
	But Janus you cant keep it completely secret forever
	I dont intend to Once we move out of the Solar System we will all know where were going Till then as few as possible will know and those few will learn as late as possible
	Her promotion Insigna noted with a little shame cooled her objections
	On another occasion Pitt said to her What about your husband
	What about my husband Insigna was immediately on the defensive
	He is an Earthman I understand
	Insignas lips pressed together He is of Earth origin but he is a Rotorian citizen
	I understand I assume you have told him nothing of Nemesis
	Absolutely nothing
	Has this husband of yours ever told you why he left Earth and worked so hard to become a Rotorian citizen
	No he hasnt And I havent asked him
	But dont you ever wonder
	Insigna hesitated and then told the truth Yes I have sometimes Pitt smiled I should tell you perhaps
	And he did little by little Never in any overly obtrusive manner It was never a bludgeon it was rather the dripping of water at every conversation It brought her out of her intellectual shell To live on Rotor after all made it entirely too easy to consider only things Rotorian
	But thanks to Pitt to what he told her to the films he suggested she view she became aware of Earth and its billions of its endemic starvation and violence its drugs and alienation She began to understand it as an abysmal pit of misery something to flee from She did not wonder any longer why Crile Fisher had left She wondered why so few Earthmen followed his example
	Nor were the Settlements so much better off She became aware of how they closed in on themselves how people were prevented from moving freely from one to another No Settlement wanted the microscopic flora and fauna of any other Trade dwindled slowly and was increasingly carried on by automated vessels with carefully sterilized loads
	The Settlements quarreled and found each other hateful The circumMartian Settlements were almost as bad Only in the asteroid zone were the Settlements multiplying freely and even those were growing suspicious of all the inner Settlements
	Insigna could feel herself begin to agree with Pitt even to grow enthusiastic over a flight from intolerable misery and the beginning of a system of worlds where the seeds of suffering had been eradicated A new start a new chance
	And then she found that a baby was on the way and her enthusiasm began to wither To risk herself and Crile on the long journey seemed worthwhile To risk an infant a child
	Pitt was unperturbed He congratulated her It will be born here and you will have a little time to accustom yourself to the situation It will be at least a year and a half before were ready to go And by then you will realize how fortunate you will be not to have to wait any longer The child will have no memory of the misery of a ruined planet and a desperately divided humanity It will know only a new world with a cultural understanding among its members Lucky child Fortunate child My son and daughter are already grown already marked
	And again Insigna began to think in that fashion and by the time Marlene was born she had indeed begun to dread delay to fear that before they left the child would be imprinted with the crowded failure that was the Solar System
	She was entirely on Pitts side by this time Fisher seemed fascinated by Marlene to Insignas great relief She had not thought that he would make much of a father Yet he hovered over Marlene and took on his share of the duties involved in bringing her up He seemed actually to grow cheerful as a result
	During the time Marlene was approaching her first birthday rumors grew throughout the Solar System that Rotor intended to leave It produced what was almost a systemwide crisis and Pitt who was now clearly in line for Commissionerhood was grimly amused
	Well what can they do he said Theres no way they can stop us and all the outcries of disloyalty together with their own display of Solar System chauvinism will only serve to inhibit their investigations into hyperassistance which will serve us well
	Insigna said But how did it get out I wonder Janus
	I saw to it that it did He smiled  At this point I dont any longer object to their learning the fact of our leaving as long as they dont know our destination It would after all be impossible to hide our leaving for much longer We must take a vote on the matter you know and once all Rotorians know of our leaving all the rest of the system will know in any case
	A vote
	Why of course Think it through We cant take off with a Settlementload of people who are too fearful or too homesick for their own Sun Wed never make it We want only those with us who are willing even eager
	He was completely right The campaign to win approval for leaving the Solar System began almost at once and the fact that the news had already leaked out served as a cushion to ease the reaction outside Rotorand within it as well
	Some Rotorians were excited at the prospect some were afraid Fisher reacted with thunderous brow and one day he said This is  crazy
	Its inevitable said Insigna with careful neutrality
	Why Theres no reason to start wandering among the stars Where would we go Theres nothing out there
	There are billions of stars out there
	How many planets We dont know of any habitable planets anywhere and very few of any other kind Our Solar System is the only home we know
	Exploration is in the blood of humanity It was one of Pitts phrases
	Thats romantic nonsense Does anyone think that people are actually going to vote to separate themselves from humanity and vanish into space
	Insigna said My understanding Crile is that sentiment on Rotor is rather in favor of it
	Thats just Council propaganda You think people will vote to leave the Earth Leave the Sun Never If it comes to that well be going to Earth
	She felt something clutch at her heart She said Oh no Do you want one of those simoons or blizzards or mistrals or whatever you call them Do you want lumps of ice and falling water and blowing whistling air
	He lifted his eyebrows at her Its not that bad There are storms occasionally but they can be predicted Actually theyre interesting when theyre not too bad Its fascinatinga little cold a little heat a little precipitation It makes for variation It keeps you alive And then think of the variety of cuisines
	Cuisines How can you say that Most people on Earth are starving Were always collecting food shipments to send to Earth
	Some people go hungry Its not universal
	Well you certainly cant expect Marlene to live under such conditions
	Billions of children do
	And mine wont be one of them said Insigna fiercely
	All her hopes lay in Marlene now She was going on ten months of age had two small teeth in the upper gum two in the lower could shamble about holding onto the rods of her playpen and looked at the world with those wondering intelligent eyes
	Fisher was still clearly fond of his unpretty daughter more fond than ever in fact When he wasnt dandling her he was staring at her and remarking fondly on her beautiful eyes He stressed her one lovely feature and it seemed to make up to him for everything else that was lacking
	Surely Fisher would not go back to Earth if it meant leaving Marlene forever Insigna somehow lacked any confidence that he would choose her the woman he had loved and married over Earth but surely Marlene would be the sticking point
	Surely
	The day after the vote Eugenia Insigna found Fisher white with rage He said or choked out It was a fixed vote
	She said Sh Youll wake the baby
	And for a moment he grimaced and visibly held his breath Insigna relaxed just a bit and said in a small voice Theres no question that the people want to go
	Did you vote to go
	She considered There was no use trying to placate him by lying She had made her feelings obvious enough She said I did
	He said Pitt ordered you to I suppose
	That caught her by surprise No Im capable of making my own decisions
	But you and he He let it trail off
	She felt her blood pressure rise suddenly What do you mean she said angry now in her turn Was he going to accuse her of infidelity
	Thatthat politician Hes heading for Commissioner at any price Everyone knows that And youre planning to rise with him Political loyalty will get you someplace too wont it
	Where will it get me Theres no place I want to get Im an astronomer not a politician
	Youve been promoted havent you Youve been pushed over the head of older more experienced people
	Through hard work I like to think How was she going to defend herself now without being able to tell him the truth
	Im sure you do like to think that But it was through Pitt Insigna drew a deep breath Where is this leading us
	Listen His voice was low as it had been since she had reminded him that Marlene was sleeping I cannot believe that a whole Settlement of people are going to risk traveling with hyperassistance How do you know what will happen How do you know it will work It could kill us all
	The Far Probe worked well
	Were there living things on this Far Probe If not how do you know how living things will react to hyperassistance What do you know about hyperassistance
	Not a thing
	Why not Youre working right there in the laboratory Youre not working on the farms as I am
	He is jealous thought Insigna Aloud she said When you say the laboratory you seem to imply were all piled together in one room I told you Im an astronomer and I know nothing about hyperassistance 
	You mean that Pitt never tells you anything about it
	About hyperassistance He doesnt know himself
	Are you telling me no one knows
	Of course Im not telling you that The hyperspatialists know Come on Crile Those who are supposed to know know Others dont
	To all except the specialist few its a secret then
	Exactly
	Then you dont really know that hyperassistance is safe Only the hyperspatialists know How do you suppose they know
	I assume theyve experimented
	You assume 
	Its a reasonable assumption They assure us its safe
	And they never lie I suppose
	Theyll be going too Besides Im sure they experimented
	He looked at her out of narrowed eyes Now youre sure The Far Probe was your baby Did they have lifeforms aboard
	I was not involved with the actual procedures I only dealt with the astronomical data that was gained
	Youre not answering my question about the lifeforms
	Insigna lost her patience Look I dont feel like being grilled endlessly and the baby is beginning to be restless I have a question or two myself What do you plan to do Are you coming along
	I dont have to The terms of the vote are that anyone who doesnt want to come along doesnt have to
	I know you dont have to but will you Surely you dont want to break up the family
	She tried to smile as she said this but it didnt feel convincing Fisher said slowly and a little grimly I also dont want to leave the Solar System
	You would rather leave me And Marlene
	Why would I have to leave Marlene Even if you want to risk yourself on this wild scheme must you risk the child
	She said tightly If I go Marlene goes Get that through your head Crile Where would you take her To some halffinished asteroidal Settlement
	Of course not Im from Earth and I can return there if I wish
	Return to a dying planet Great
	Its got some years of life left to it I assure you
	Then why did you leave it
	I thought Id be improving myself I didnt know that coming to Rotor would mean a oneway ticket to nowhere
	Not to nowhere Insigna burst out tormented past endurance If you knew where we were going you wouldnt be so ready to turn back
	Why Where is Rotor going
	To the stars
	To oblivion
	They stared at each other and Marlene opening her eyes emitted a soft mew of wakefulness Fisher looked down at the baby and with a softening of his tone said Eugenia we dont have to split up I certainly dont want to leave Marlene Or you either Come with me
	To Earth
	Yes Why not I have friends there Even now As my wife and child youll have no trouble getting in Earth doesnt worry much about ecological balance Well be on a whole giant planet out there not on a little stinking bubble in space
	Just on a whole giant bubble enormously stinking No no never
	Let me take Marlene then If you find the voyage worth the risk because you are an astronomer and want to study the Universe thats your business but the baby should stay here in the Solar System and be safe
	Safe on Earth Dont be ridiculous Is that what this whole thing has been for A device to take my baby
	Our baby
	My baby You leave I want you to leave but you cant touch my baby You tell me I know Pitt and yes I do That means I can arrange to have you sent to the asteroids whether you want to go or not and then you can find your own way back to your decomposing Earth Now get out of my quarters and find your own place to sleep till you are sent away When you let me know where youll be Ill send along your personal possessions And dont think you can come back This place will be under guard
	At the moment that Insigna said this with the bitterness in her heart overflowing she meant it She might have pled with him cajoled him begged argued But she hadnt She had turned a harsh unforgiving eye upon him and had sent him away
	And Fisher did leave And she did send along his things And he did refuse to come with Rotor And he was sent away And she supposed he had gone to Earth
	He was gone forever from her and from Marlene She had sent him away and he was gone forever


Five Gift


	Insigna sat there deeply surprised at herself She had never told the story to anyone though she had lived with it almost every day for fourteen years She had never dreamed of telling it to anyone She had assumed that she would take it to the grave with her Not that it was disgraceful in any waymerely private And here she had told itat length and without reserveto her adolescent daughter to someone who until the moment she had begun talking she had considered a childa peculiarly hopeless child
	And that child now looked at her solemnly out of her dark eyesunblinking owlishly adult somehowand finally said Then you did drive him away didnt you
	In a way yes But I was furious He wanted to take you To Earth  She paused then said tentatively You understand
	Marlene asked Did you want me so much Insigna said indignantly Certainly And then under the calm gaze of those eyes she stopped to think the unthinkable Had she really wanted Marlene
	But then she calmly said Of course Why wouldnt I Marlene shook her head and for a moment there was that sullen look on her face I think I probably wasnt a charming baby Perhaps he wanted me Were you unhappy because he wanted me more than he wanted you Did you keep me just because he wanted me
	What horrible things youre saying Thats not it at all said Insigna not at all sure whether she believed that or not There was getting to be no comfort in discussing these things with Marlene More and more Marlene was developing this dreadful way of cutting under the skin Insigna had noticed this before and had put it down to the occasional lucky blows of an unhappy child But it was happening more and more often and Marlene now seemed to be wielding the scalpel deliberately
	Insigna said Marlene What made you think I had driven your father away I had never said so surely or given you any reason to think so have I
	I dont really know how I know things Mother Sometimes you mention Father to me or to someone else and you always sound as though theres something you regret something you wish you could do over
	There is I never feel that
	And little by little as I get these impressions they get clearer Its the way you talk the way you look
	Insigna gazed at her daughter intently then said very suddenly What am I thinking
	Marlene jumped slightly and then gave a short giggle She was not a laugher and that giggle was as far as ever she wentusually She said Thats easy Youre thinking that I know what youre thinking but youre wrong I dont read minds I just tell from words and sounds and expressions and movements People just cant keep what they think hidden And Ive watched them so long
	Why I mean why have you felt it necessary to watch them
	Because when I was a kid everyone lied to me They told me how sweet I was Or they told you that when I was listening They always had a look plastered allover them that said I dont really think that at all And they didnt even know it was there I couldnt believe at first they didnt know But then I said to myself I guess its more comfortable for them to make believe theyre telling the truth 
	Marlene paused and then abruptly asked her mother Why didnt you tell Father where we were going
	I couldnt It was not my secret
	Perhaps if you had he would have come with us
	Insigna shook her head vigorously No he wouldnt He had made up his mind to return to Earth
	But if you had told him Mother Commissioner Pitt wouldnt have let him leave would he Father would have known too much
	Pitt wasnt Commissioner then said Insigna with absent irrelevance Then with sudden vigor I wouldnt have wanted him on those terms Would you
	I dont know I cant tell how he would have been if he had stayed
	But I can tell Insigna felt as though she were burning again Her mind went back to that last conversation and her last wild shout telling Fisher to go that he must go No it had been no mistake She wouldnt have wanted him as a prisoner an enforced member of Rotor She hadnt loved him that much For that matter she hadnt hated him that much either
	And then she changed the subject quickly allowing no time for her expression to give her away You upset Aurinel this afternoon Why did you tell him Earth would be destroyed He came to me about that and was very concerned
	All you had to do was to tell him that I was just a kid and no one listens to what a kid says He would have believed that right away
	Insigna ignored that Maybe it was a good idea to say nothing in order to avoid the truth Do you really think Earth will be destroyed
	I do You talk about Earth sometimes You say Poor Earth You almost always say Poor Earth 
	Insigna felt herself flush Did she really speak of Earth in those terms She said Well why not Its overcrowded wornout full of hatred and famines and miseries Im sorry for the world Poor Earth
	No Mother You dont say it that way When you say it Marlene held up her hand in a groping gesture feeling for something her fingertips just missing it
	Well Marlene
	Its clear in my mind but I dont know how to put it in words
	Keep on trying I must know
	The way you say it I cant help but think you feel guiltyas though it were your fault
	Why What do you think Ive done
	I heard you say it once when you were in the view room You looked at Nemesis and it seemed to me then that Nemesis was mixed up in it So I asked the computer what Nemesis meant and it told me Its something that relentlessly destroys something that infiicts retribution
	That wasnt the reason for the name cried Insigna You named it said Marlene quietly inexorably
	That was no secret of course any longer once they had left the Solar System behind them Insigna had then taken the credit for the discovery and for the name
	Its because I named it that I know that that wasnt the reason for the name
	Then why do you feel guilty Mother
	Silenceif you dont want to tell the truth
	Insigna said at last How do you think Earth will be destroyed
	I dont know but I think you know Mother
	Were speaking at crosspurposes Marlene and lets let it go for now What I want though is to make sure you understand that you are not to talk about any of this to anyonenot about your father and not about this nonsense of Earths destruction
	If you dont want me to of course I wont but the destruction bit is not nonsense
	I say it is Well define it as nonsense
	Marlene nodded I think Ill go view for a while she said with seeming indifference Then Ill go to bed
	Good Insigna watched her daughter leave
	Guilty thought Insigna I feel guilty I wear it on my face like a bright banner Anyone who looks can see it
	No not anyone Just Marlene She has the gift of doing so Marlene had to have something to compensate for all she didnt get
	Intelligence wasnt enough It didnt make up sufficiently so she had this gift of reading expression intonation and otherwise invisible bodily twitches so that no secret was safe from her
	How long had she kept this dangerous attribute to herself How long had she known about it Was it something that grew stronger with age Why did she allow it to emerge now to peep out from behind the curtain she seemed to have drawn over it and to use it as something with which to beat her mother
	Was it because Aurinel had rejected her finally and definitely according to what she had seen in him Was she striking out blindly in consequence
	Guilty thought Insigna Why shouldnt I feel guilty It is all my fault I should have known from the start from the instant of discoverybut I didnt want to know


Six Approach


	How early had she known From the moment she had named the star Nemesis Had she felt what it was and what it meant and had she named it appropriately without conscious thought
	When she had first spotted the star it had been only the act of finding it that counted There had been no room in her mind for anything but immortality It was her own star Insignas Star She had been tempted to call it that How glorious that had sounded even as she had reluctantly avoided it with a hollow internal grimace of mock modesty How unbearable it would have been now if she had fallen into that trap
	After the discovery there had come the shock of Pitts demand for secrecy and then the furious preparation for the Leaving Would that be what it would be called in the history books someday The Leaving Capitalized
	Then after the Leaving there were two years in which the ship skipped steadily and barely into and out of hyperspaceand the endless calculations that were involved in that hyperassistance for which astronomical data was constantly required with herself supervising the supply The density and composition of interstellar matter alone
	At no time in those four years had she been able to think of Nemesis in detail not once could she zero in on the obvious
	Was that possible Or did she simply turn away from what she did not want to see Had she deliberately sought refuge in all the secrecy and scurry and excitement that presented itself to her
	But there came a time when the last hyperspatial period was behind them when for a month they would be decelerating through an initial hail of hydrogen atoms which they struck with such speed that those atoms were converted into cosmic ray particles
	No ordinary space vehicle could have endured that but Rotor had a layer of soil around it that had been thickened for the trip and the particles were absorbed
	There would come a time she had been assured by one of the hyperspatialists when one would enter and leave hyperspace at ordinary speeds Given hyperspace in the first place he had said no new conceptual breakthrough is required Its just engineering
	Maybe The remaining hyperspatialists however considered the notion so much star exhaust
	Insignia hurried in to see Pitt when the appalling truth descended upon her He had had little time for her in the last year and she had understood There was a certain tension that became more and more evident as the excitement of the trip wound down as people realized that in a matter of months they would be in the neighborhood of anther star They would then have the constant problem of having to survive over a long period in the vicinity of a strange red dwarf star without any guarantee of reasonable planetary material to serve as a supply source let alone a living place
	Janus Pitt no longer looked like a young man although his hair was still dark his face unlined Only four years had passed since she had come to him with the news of Nemesis existence There was however a harried look in his eyes a sense of having had his joy rubbed away and his cares left naked to the world
	He was Commissionerelect now Perhaps that might account for a great deal of what might be troubling him but who could tell Insignia had never known true poweror the responsibility that accompanied itbut something told her it might have the capacity for souring one who did
	Pitt smiled at her absently They had been forced to be close when they had shared a secret that at first no oneand then almost no one had shared with them They could then talk unguardedly with each other when they could not do so with anyone else After the Leaving however when the secret was revealed they had grown apart again
	Janus she said there is something eating away at me and I had to come to you with it Its Nemesis
	Is there anything new You cant say youve found out it isnt where you thought it was Its right out there less than sixteen billion kilometers away We can see it
	Yes I know But when I first found it at a distance of twoplus lightyears I took it for granted that it was a companion star that Nemesis and the Sun were circling a common center of gravity Something that close would almost have to be It would be so dramatic
	All right Why shouldnt things be dramatic now and then
	Because as close as it is it is clearly too far away to be a companion star The gravitational attraction between Nemesis and the Sun is terribly weak so weak that the gravitational perturbations of nearby stars would make the orbit unstable
	But Nemesis is there
	Yes and more or less between ourselves and Alpha Centauri
	What has Alpha Centauri got to do with it
	The fact is that Nemesis is not much farther from Alpha Centauri than it is from the Sun Its just as likely to be a companion star of Alpha Centauri Or more likely whichever system it belongs to the presence of the other star is now disrupting it or has already disrupted it
	Pitt looked at Insigna thoughtfully and tapped his fingers lightly on the arm of his chair How long does it take Nemesis to go around the Sunassuming its the Suns companion
	I dont know Id have to work out its orbit Thats something I should have done before the Leaving but there were so many other things occupying me then and now toobut thats no excuse
	Well make a guess Insigna said If its a circular orbit it would take Nemesis just over fifty million years to make a circuit about the Sun or more properly about the center of gravity of the system with the Sun making a similar circuit The line between the two as they moved would always pass through that center On the other hand if Nemesis is following a highly elliptical orbit and is now at its farthestas it must be for if it ventured farther still it would certainly not be a companion starthen perhaps as little as twentyfive million years 
	Last time then that Nemesis was in this position more or less between Alpha Centauri and the Sun Alpha Centauri must have been in a much different position than it is now Twentyfive to fifty million years would move Alpha Centauri wouldnt it How much
	A good fraction of a lightyear
	Would that mean that this is the first time Nemesis is being fought over by the two stars Till now would it have been circling peacefully
	Not a chance Janus Even if you count out Alpha Centauri there are other stars One star may have arrived now but there had to be another star in interfering distance at some other part of its orbit in the past The orbit just isnt stable
	Whats it doing here in our neighborhood then if it isnt orbiting the Sun
	Exactly said Insigna
	What do you mean exactly
	If it were orbiting the Sun it would be moving at a speed relative to the Sun of somewhere between eighty and one hundred meters a second depending on Nemesis mass Thats very slow motion for a star so it would seem to stay in the same place for a long time It would therefore remain behind the cloud for a long time especially if the cloud is moving in the same direction relative to the Sun With such a slow motion and its light dimmed its no wonder its never been noticed till now However She paused
	Pitt who made no effort to seem devouringly interested sighed and said Well Can you get to the point
	Well if its not in orbit about the Sun then it is in independent motion and it should be moving relative to the Sun at a hundred kilometers a second or so a thousand times as fast as if it were in orbit It just happens to be in our neighborhood now but it is moving on will pass the Sun and will never return But just the same it stays behind the cloud scarcely budging from its position
	Why should that be
	Theres one way it can be moving at a good clip and yet not seem to be moving from its position in the sky
	Dont tell me its vibrating back and forth Insignas lip curled Please dont try to make jokes Janus This isnt funny Nemesis might be moving more or less straight toward the Sun It wouldnt be shifting either to the right or left so that it would not seem to be changing position but it would be coming right toward us that is right toward the Solar System
	Pitt stared at her in surpriseIs there evidence for that
	Not yet There was no reason to take the spectrum of Nemesis when it was first spotted It was only after I had noticed the parallax that a spectral analysis would have made sense and then I never got around to it If you remember you put me at the head of the Far Probe project and told me to direct everyones attention away from Nemesis I couldnt have arranged a close spectral analysis at that time and since the Leavingwell I havent But I will investigate the matter now you can be sure
	Let me ask you a question Wouldnt it produce the same effect of motionlessness if Nemesis were moving directly away from the Sun Its a fiftyfifty chance whether its moving toward the Sun or away from it isnt it
	Spectral analysis will tell us A red shift of the spectral lines will mean theres a recession a violet shift an approach
	But its too late now If you take its spectrum it will tell you its approaching us because were approaching it
	Right now I wouldnt take the spectrum of Nemesis Id take it of the Sun If Nemesis is approaching the Sun then the Sun will be approaching Nemesis and we can allow for our own motion Besides were slowing and in a month or so we will be moving so slowly that our motion wont be affecting the spectroscopic results appreciably
	For the space of half a minute Pitt seemed lost in thought staring at his uncluttered desk his hand slowly stroking the computer terminal Then he said without bothering to look up No These are observations that need not be made I dont want you worrying yourself about it any more Eugenia Its a nonproblem so just forget it
	The wave of his hand made it clear that she was to leave
	Insignas breath made a whistling sound as it was forced out of angrily tightened nostrils She said in a low husky voice How dare you Janus How dare you
	How dare I what Pitt frowned
	How dare you order me out of here as though I were a computerpuncher If I hadnt found Nemesis we wouldnt be here You wouldnt be Commissionerelect Nemesis is mine I have a say in it
	Nemesis isnt yours Its Rotors So please leave now and let me get on with the business of the day
	Janus she said raising her voice I tell you again that in all likelihood Nemesis is moving toward our Solar System
	And I tell you again that it is only a fiftyfifty chance that it is And even if it were heading toward the Solar Systemnot our Solar System any longer by the way but their Solar Systemdont tell me its going to hit the Sun I wont believe you if you do In its whole nearly fivebillionyear history the Sun has never been struck by a star or even come close The odds against stellar collisions even in relatively crowded parts of the Galaxy are enormous I may not be an astronomer but I know that much
	Odds are just odds Janus not certainties Its conceivable however unlikely that N emesis and the Sun might collide but I recognize that its very unlikely they will The trouble is that a close approach even without collision might be fatal to Earth
	How close is a close approach
	I dont know It will take a great deal of computation
	All right then You suggest that we take the trouble to make the necessary observations and computations and if we find out that the situation is indeed fraught with danger to the Solar System then what Do we warn the Solar System
	Well yes What choice would we have
	And how would we warn them We have no means of hypercommunication and even if we had they have no system for receiving hypermessages If we sent out a luminal message of some sortlight microwaves modulated neutrinosit would take over two years to reach Earth assuming we have a beam powerful enough or sufficiently coherent And even then how would we know if they had received it If they had and bothered to answer that answer would take another two years to return And what will be the final result of the warning We will have to tell them where Nemesis is and they will see that the information is coming from that direction The whole point of our secrecy the whole plan for establishing a homogeneous civilization around Nemesis free of interference would be lost
	Whatever the cost Janus how could you consider not warning them
	Wheres your concern Even if Nemesis is moving toward the Sun how long would it take for it to reach the Solar System
	It could reach the neighborhood of the Sun in five thousand years
	Pitt sat back in his chair and regarded Insigna with a kind of wry amusement Five thousand years Only five thousand years Look Eugenia two hundred and fifty years ago the first Earthman stood on the Moon Two and a half centuries have passed and here we are at the nearest star Where will we be in another two and a half centuries at this rate At any star we wish And in five thousand years fifty centuries we will be allover the Galaxy barring the presence of other intelligent forms of life We will be reaching out to other galaxies Within five thousand years technology will have advanced to the point where if the Solar System were really in trouble all its Settlements and its entire planetary population could take off for deep space and other stars
	Insigna shook her head Dont think that technological advance means that you can empty the Solar System by a mere wave of the hand Janus To remove billions of people without chaos and without tremendous loss of life would require long preparation If they are in mortal danger five thousand years from now they must know now It is not too soon to begin to plan
	Pitt said You have a good heart Eugenia so Ill offer a compromise Suppose we take a hundred years in which to establish ourselves here to multiply to build a cluster of Settlements that will be strong enough and stable enough to be secure Then we can investigate Nemesis destination andif necessarywarn the Solar System They will still have nearly five thousand years in which to prepare Surely a small delay of a century will not be fatal
	Insigna sighed Is that your vision of the future Humanity squabbling endlessly over the stars Each little group trying to establish itself as supreme over this star or that Endless hatred suspicion and conflict of the kind we had on Earth for thousands of years expanded into the Galaxy for thousands more
	Eugenia I have no vision Humanity will do as it pleases It will squabble as you say or it will perhaps set up a Galactic Empire or do something else I cant dictate what humanity will do and I dont intend to try to shape it For myself I have only this one Settlement to care for and this one century in which to establish it at Nemesis By then you and I will be safely dead and our successors will handle the problem of warning the Solar Systemif that should be necessary Im trying to be reasonable not emotional Eugenia You are a reasonable person too Think about it
	Insigna did She sat there looking somberly at Pitt while he waited with almost exaggerated patience
	Finally she said Very well I see your point I will get on with analyzing Nemesis motion relative to the Sun Perhaps we can forget the whole thing
	No Pitt raised an admonishing finger Remember what I said earlier These observations will not be made If it turns out that the Solar System is not in danger we will have gained nothing We will then merely do what I insist we do in any casespend a century strengthening the civilization of Rotor If however you find that there is danger then your conscience will hurt and you will be consumed with apprehensions and fears and guilt The news will somehow get out and it will weaken the resolve of Rotorians many of whom may be as sentimental as you are We would then lose a great deal Do you understand me
	She was silent and he said Good I see you do Again the wave of his hand made it clear that she was to leave
	This time she left and Pitt looking after her thought She is really becoming insupportable


Seven Destruction


	Marlene watched her mother owlishly She was careful to keep her expression flat and meaningless but within herself she was both pleased and surprised Her mother was finally telling her of the events involving her father and Commissioner Pitt She was being treated as a grownup
	Marlene said I would have checked Nemesis motions regardless of what Commissioner Pitt said Mother but I see you didnt Your guilt makes it plain
	Insigna said I cant get used to the notion that I wear my guilt like a label on my forehead
	No one hides their feelings said Marlene If you really watch you can always tell
	Others couldnt Marlene had learned that only slowly and with difficulty People just didnt look they didnt sense they didnt care They didnt watch faces and bodies and sounds and attitudes and little nervous habits
	You shouldnt really watch like that Marlene said Insigna as though their thoughts had taken parallel paths She put her arm around the girls shoulder to prevent her words from sounding like a scolding People get nervous when those large dark eyes of yours fix on them soulfully Respect peoples privacy
	Yes Mother said Marlene noting without effort that her mother was trying to protect herself She was nervous about herself wondering how much she gave away at each moment
	Then Marlene said How is it that despite all your guilty feelings about the Solar System you did nothing
	A number of reasons Molly
	Not Molly thought Marlene with anguish Marlene Marlene Marlene Three syllables Accent on the second Grown up
	Like what reasons asked Marlene sulkily Couldnt her mother detect the wave of hostility that swept over Marlene each time a kid name was used Surely it twisted her face smoldered her eyes convulsed her lips Why didnt people notice Why didnt people look
	For one thing Janus Pitt was very convincing However odd the points he makes however hostile you feel toward them at the time he always makes you see that he has good reasons for his viewpoints
	If thats true Mother hes awfully dangerous
	Insigna seemed to break away from her thoughts to glance curiously at her daughter Why do you say that
	Every point of view can have good reasons behind it If someone can seize those reasons quickly and present them convincingly he can argue anyone into anything and thats dangerous
	Janus Pitt has those abilities Ill admit Im surprised you understand these things
	Marlene thought Because Im only fifteen and youre used to thinking Im a child
	Aloud she said You learn a lot watching people
	Yes but remember what I told you Control the watching Never So Mr Pitt persuaded you
	He made me see thered be no harm in waiting awhile
	And you werent even curious to study Nemesis and see exactly where it was going You would have to be
	I was but its not as easy as you think The Observatory is in constant use You have to wait your turn to use the instruments Even if Im the head I cant use them freely Then too when someone does use them theres no secret about it We know what its being used for and why There was very little chance I would be able to develop a really detailed spectrum of Nemesis and of the Sun or to use the Observatory computer on the necessary calculations without people knowing at once what I was doing I suspect that Pitt had a few people in the Observatory watching me too If I had stepped out of line he would have known at once
	He couldnt do anything to you about it could he
	He couldnt have me shot for treason if thats what you meannot that hed dream of doing such a thingbut he could relieve me of my Observatory duties and put me to work in the farms I wouldnt want that It wasnt long after Id had that little talk with Pitt that we discovered that Nemesis had a planetor a companion star To this day were not sure what to call it They were only separated by a distance of four million kilometers and the companion object didnt radiate in visible light at all
	Youre talking about Megas arent you Mother
	Yes I am Its an old word meaning big and for a planet its very big considerably bigger than the Solar Systems largest planet Jupiter But its very small for a star Some think of Megas as a brown dwarf She broke off and eyed her daughter narrowly as though suddenly uncertain as to her capacity to absorb matters Do you know what a brown dwarf is Molly
	Marlene is my name Mother Insigna flushed slightly Yes Im sorry if I forget now and then I cant help it you know I had a very dear little girl once whose name was Molly
	I know And next time Im six you can call me Molly all you want
	Insigna laughed Do you know what a brown dwarf is Marlene
	Yes I do Mother A brown dwarf is a small starlike body with too little mass to develop the temperatures and pressures to bring about hydrogen fusion in its interior but enough mass to bring about secondary reactions that keep it warm
	Thats right Not bad Megas is on the borderline Its either a very warm planet or a very dim brown dwarf It gives off no visible light but emits richly in the infrared Its not quite like anything weve ever studied It was the first extrasolar planetary bodythat is the first planet outside the Solar Systemthat we have been able to study in detail and the Observatory was totally immersed in it I wouldnt have had a chance to work on Nemesis motion even if I had wanted to and to tell you the truth I forgot about it for a time I was as interested in Megas as everyone else was you see
	Um said Marlene
	It turned out it was the only sizable planetary body circling Nemesis but it was enough It was five times the mass
	I know Mother Its five times the mass of Jupiter and one thirtieth the mass of Nemesis The computer taught me that long ago
	Of course dear And its no more habitable than Jupiter is less if anything That was disappointing at first even though we didnt really expect to find a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star If a planet were close enough to a star like Nemesis to keep water liquid tidal influences would force it to face one side to Nemesis at all times
	Isnt that what Megas does Mother I mean one side always faces Nemesis
	Yes it does That means it has a warm side and cold side with the warm side quite warm It would be at red heat if it werent that the circulation of its dense atmosphere tends to equalize temperatures somewhat Because of this and because of Megas own inner warmth even the cold side is quite warm There are many things about Megas that were unique in astronomical experience And then we discovered that Megas had a satellite or if you want to consider Megas a very small star it had a planetErythro
	Which Rotor orbits I know But Mother its been over eleven years since there was all that fuss about Megas and Erythro In all that time havent you managed to sneak a look at the spectra of Nemesis and the Sun Havent you done a little figuring
	Well
	Marlene said hastily I know you have
	By my expression
	By everything about you
	You can be a very uncomfortable person to have around Marlene Yes I have
	And
	Yes its heading for the Solar System
	There was a pause Then Marlene said in a low voice Is it going to hit
	No as far as my figures are concerned Im quite sure its not going to hit the Sun or the Earth or any significant part of the Solar System for that matter But it doesnt have to you see Even if it misses it will probably destroy the Earth
	It was quite clear to Marlene that her mother did not like to talk about Earths destruction that there was internal friction inhibiting her discourse that if she were left to herself she would stop talking Her expressionthe way she pulled away a little from Marlene as though anxious to leave the way she licked her lips very delicately as though she were trying to remove the taste of her wordswas clarity itself to Marlene
	But she did not want her mother to stop She had to know more She said gently If Nemesis misses how will it destroy the Earth
	Let me try to explain The Earth goes around the Sun just as Rotor goes around Erythro If all there were in the Solar System were the Earth and the Sun then the Earth would go around in the same path almost eternally I say almost because as it turns it radiates gravitational waves that bleed the Earths momentum and that causes it very very slowly to spin into the Sun We can ignore that
	There are other complicating factors because Earth isnt alone The Moon Mars Venus Jupiter every object in the neighborhood pulls at it The pulls are very minor compared to that of the Sun so Earth remains in its orbit more or less However the minor pulls which are shifting in direction and intensity in a complicated way as the various objects themselves move introduce minor changes in Earths orbit Earth moves in and out slightly its axial tilt veers and changes its slant a bit the eccentricity alters somewhat and so on
	It can be shownit has been shownthat all these minor changes are cyclic They dont progress in one direction but move back and forth What it amounts to is that the Earth in its orbit about the Sun quivers slightly in a dozen different ways All the bodies in the Solar System quiver in this way Earths quiver doesnt prevent it from supporting life At the worst it may get an ice age or an ice disappearance and a rise and fall in sea level but life has survived everything for well over three billion years
	But now let us suppose Nemesis dashes by and misses that it doesnt approach closer than a lightmonth or so That would be less than a trillion kilometers As it passesand it would take a number of years to passit would give a gravitational push to the system It would make the quivering worse but then when it was gone the quivers would settle down again
	Marlene said You look as though you think it would be a lot worse than you make it sound Whats so bad about Nemesis giving the Solar System a little extra quiverif it all settles down again afterward
	Well will it settle down again in quite the same place Thats the problem If Earths equilibrium position is a little differenta little farther from the Sun a little nearer if its orbit is a little more eccentric or its axis a little more tilted or lesshow will that affect Earths climate Even a small change might make it an uninhabitable world
	Cant you calculate it out in advance
	No Rotor isnt a good place to calculate from It quivers too and a great deal It would take considerable time and considerable calculation to deduce from my observations here exactly what path Nemesis is takingand we just wont be sure till it gets considerably closer to the Solar System long after I am dead
	So you cant tell exactly just how closely Nemesis will pass the Solar System
	It is almost impossible to calculate The gravitational field of every nearby star within a dozen lightyears has to be taken into account After all the tiniest uncalculated effect may build up to such a deviation in over two lightyears as to make a passage that is calculated as a nearhit come out actually to be a total miss Or vice versa
	Commissioner Pitt said everyone in the Solar System will be able to leave if they want to by the time Nemesis arrives Is he right
	He might be But how can one tell what will happen in five thousand years What historical twists will take place and how that will affect matters We can hope everyone will get off safely
	Even if theyre not warned said Marlene feeling rather diffident at pointing out an astronomical truism to her mother theyll find out for themselves Theyve got to Nemesis will come closer and closer and it will be unmistakable after a while and they can calculate its path much more accurately as it comes closer
	But they will have that much less time to make their escapeif one is necessary
	Marlene stared at her toes She said Mother dont be angry with me It seems to me as though youd be unhappy even if everyone got away from the Solar System safely Something else is wrong Please tell me
	Insigna said I dont like the thought of everyone leaving Earth Even if it is done in orderly fashion with plenty of time and with no casualties to speak of I still dont like the thought I dont want Earth to be abandoned
	Suppose it must be
	Then it will be I can bow to the inevitable but I dont have to like it
	Are you sentimental about Earth You studied there didnt you
	I did my graduate work in astronomy there I didnt like Earth but that doesnt matter Its the place where human beings originated Do you know what I mean Marlene Even if I didnt think much of it when I was there its still the world where life developed over the eons To me its not only a world but an idea an abstraction I want it to exist for the sake of the past I dont know if I can make that clear
	Marlene said Father was an Earthman
	Insignas lips tightened a bit Yes he was
	And he went back to Earth
	The records say he did I suppose he did
	Im half an Earthperson then Isnt that so
	Insigna frowned Were all Earthpeople Marlene My greatgreatgrandparents lived on Earth all their lives My greatgrandmother was born on Earth Everyone without exception is descended from Earthpeople And not just human beings Every speck of life on every Settlement from a virus to a tree is descended from Earth life
	Marlene said But only human beings know it And some are closer than others Do you think about Father sometimes even now Marlene looked up briefly at her mothers face and winced Its none of my business Thats what youre going to tell me
	Thats the feeling I just had but I dont have to be guided by my feelings After all youre his daughter Yes I think about him now and then She shrugged her shoulders slightly
	Insigna said Do you think about him Marlene
	I have nothing to think of I dont remember him Ive never seen any holograms or anything
	No there was no point in Her voice trailed off
	But when I was littler I used to wonder why some fathers stayed with their children when the Leaving happened and some fathers didnt I thought that maybe the ones who left didnt like their children and that Father didnt like me
	Insigna stared at her daughter You never told me that
	It was a private thought when I was little When I got older I knew that it was more complicated than that
	You should never have had to think so Its not true I would have assured you of that if I had had the slightest idea
	You dont like to talk about those times Mother I understand
	I would have anyway if I had known about that thought of yours if I could read your face as you read mine He did love you He would have taken you with him if I had allowed it Its my fault really that you two are separated
	His too He might have stayed with us
	Well he might have but now that the years have passed I can see and understand his problems a little better than I could then After all I wasnt leaving home my world was coming with me I may be over two lightyears from Earth but Im still at home on Rotor where I was born Your father was different He was born on Earth and not on Rotor and I suppose he couldnt bear the thought of leaving Earth altogether and forever I think about that now and then also I hate the thought of Earth being deserted There must be several billion people there whose hearts would break to leave it
	There was silence between them for a moment then Marlene said I wonder what Father is doing back on Earth right now
	How can we possibly tell Marlene Twenty trillion kilometers is a long long way and fourteen years is a long long time
	Do you suppose hes still alive
	We cant even know that said Insigna Life can be very short on Earth Then as though suddenly aware she wasnt talking to herself she said Im sure hes alive Marlene He was in excellent health when he left and hes only just approaching fifty now Then softly Do you miss him Marlene
	Marlene shook her head You cant miss what youve never had But you had him Mother she thought And you miss him


Eight Agent


	Oddly enough Crile Fisher found it necessary to become accustomed to Earthor reaccustomed to it He had not thought that Rotor had become so much a part of him in a matter of not quite four years It had been the longest period during which he had been away from Earth but surely it had not been long enough to make Earth seem strange to him
	There was now the sheer size of Earth the distant horizon ending sharp against the sky instead of turning up mistily There were the crowds the unchanging gravity the sense of wild and willful atmosphere of temperature soaring and diving of nature out of all control
	It was not that he had to experience any of this to feel it Even when he was in his own quarters he knew it was all out there and the ferality of it all pervaded his spirit somehow invaded it Or it might be that the room was too small too full that the drift of sound was too unmistakable as though he were being pressed in on by a crowded and decaying world
	Strange that he had missed Earth so intensely in those years on Rotor and that now that he was back on Earth he missed Rotor so intensely Was he to spend his life wanting to be where he was not
	The signal light flashed and he heard the buzz It flickeredthings on Earth tended to flicker while on Rotor everything was constant with an almost aggressive efficiency Enter he said in a low voice but it was loud enough to activate the delocking mechanism
	Garand Wyler entered Fisher knew it would be he and looked at the other with an amused expression Have you budged since I left Crile
	Here and there Ive eaten Spent some time in the bathroom
	Good Youre alive then even if you dont look it He was grinning broadly his skin smooth and brown his eyes dark his teeth white his hair thick and crisp Brooding about Rotor
	I think of it now and then
	I kept meaning to ask but never got around to it It was Snow White without the Seven Dwarfs wasnt it
	Snow White said Fisher I never saw one black person there
	In that case good riddance to them Did you know that theyre gone Fishers muscles tightened and he nearly got to his feet but he resisted the impulse He said nodding They said they would be
	They meant it They drifted away We watched as far as we could eavesdropped their radiation They pumped up speed with this hyperassistance of theirs and in a split second while we could still make them out loud and clear they were gone Everything cut off
	Did you pick them up when they got back into space
	Several times Each time weaker They were traveling at the speed of light after they had really flexed their muscles and after three blips into hyperspace and back into space they were too far to be picked up
	Fisher said bitterly Their choice They kicked out the nayslike me
	Im sorry you werent there You should have been It was interesting to watch You know there were some hardliners who insisted to the very end that hyperassistance was a fraud that it was all faked up for some reason
	Rotor had the Far Probe They couldnt have it sent as far away as they did without hyperassistance
	Faked Thats what the hardliners said
	It was genuine
	Yes now they know it was All of them When Rotor just vanished off the instruments there was no other explanation Every settlement was watching No mistake It vanished on every set of instruments at the same second The irritating thing is we cant tell where its going
	Alpha Centauri I suppose Where else
	The Office keeps thinking that it might not be Alpha Centauri and that you might know that
	Fisher looked annoyed Ive been debriefed all the way to the Moon and back I havent held back anything
	Sure We know that Its nothing you know about They want me to talk to you friend to friend and see what you may know that you dont know about Something may turn up that you havent thought of You were there four years married had a kid You couldnt have missed everything
	How could I If there were the slightest notion that I was after anything Id have been kicked off Just being from Earth made me completely suspect If I hadnt marriedgiven that kind of proof that I planned to stay RotorianI would have been kicked off anyway And as it was they kept me far away from anything critical or sensitive
	Fisher looked away  And it worked My wife was just an astronomer I didnt have my pick you know I couldnt put an ad on holovision announcing that I was in the market for a young lady who was a hyperspatialist If I had met one I would have done my best to hook on to her even if she looked like a hyena but I never met one in all my time there The technology was so sensitive I think they kept the key people in complete isolation I think they must all have worn masks in the laboratories and used code names Four yearsand I never got a hint never found out a thing And I knew it would mean I was through with the Office
	He turned to Garand and said with sudden passion Things got so bad that I turned into some kind of lout The sense of failure was just overpowering
	Wyler was sitting across the table from Fisher in the cluttered
	room teetering back on the rear legs of his chair but carefully holding the table lest he teeter too far
	He said Crile the Office cant afford to be delicate but it isnt totally unfeeling They regret having to approach you like this but they must And I regret being given the job but I must We are concerned that youve failed and brought us nothing If Rotor hadnt left we might have felt there was nothing to bring But they did leave They did have hyperassistance and yet youve brought us nothing
	I know that
	But that doesnt mean we want to throw you out orget rid of you We hope we can still use you So I have to make sure that your failure was an honest one
	What does that mean
	I have to be able to tell them that you didnt fail because of any personal weakness After all you married a Rotorian woman Was she pretty Were you fond of her
	Fisher snarled What youre really asking is whether out of love for a Rotorian woman I deliberately protected Rotor and helped them keep their secret
	Well said Wyler unmoved Did you
	How can you ask that If I had decided to be a Rotorian I would have left with them By now I would be lost in space and you might never find me But I didnt do that I got off Rotor and returned to Earth even though I knew my failure would probably destroy my career
	We appreciate your loyalty
	Theres more loyalty in this than you think
	We recognize that you probably loved your wife and that as a matter of duty you had to leave her That would count in your favor if we could be sure
	Not so much my wife It was my daughter
	Wyler viewed Fisher thoughtfully We know you have a oneyearold daughter Crile Under the circumstances perhaps you shouldnt have given that particular hostage to fortune
	I agree But I cant treat myself as though I were a welloiled robot Things happen against ones will sometimes And once the child was born and I had had her for a year
	That is understandable but it was only a year Scarcely time really to build a relationship
	Fisher grimaced You may think it understandable but you dont understand 
	Explain then Ill try
	It was my sister you see My younger sister
	Wyler nodded Theres mention of that in your compufile Rose I think
	Roseanne She died in the San Francisco riots eight years ago She was only seventeen
	Im sorry
	She wasnt a participant on either side She was one of those innocent bystanders who is so more apt to get hurt than the ringleaders or the officers At least we found her body and I had something to cremate
	Wyler maintained a halfembarrassed silence
	Fisher said finally She was only seventeen Our parents died he brushed his hand to one side as though indicating it was not something he wished to discusswhen she was four and I was fourteen I worked after school and I saw to it that she was fed and clothed and comfortable even when I was not I taught myself programmingnot that I ever made a decent living out of that eitherand then when she was seventeen when she had never hurt a soul when she didnt even know what all the fighting and shouting was about she was simply trapped 
	Wyler said I can see why you volunteered for Rotor
	Oh yes For a couple of years I was just numb I joined the Office partly to keep my mind occupied and partly because I thought there would be danger in it I rather looked forward to death for a whileif I could manage to do something useful en route When the problem of placing an agent on Rotor was discussed I volunteered for it I wanted to get off Earth 
	And now youre back Do you regret that
	A little bit yes but Rotor choked me With all its faults Earth has room If only you could have seen Roseanne Garand You have no idea She wasnt pretty but she had such eyes Fishers own eyes were focused on the past a slight pucker between his brows as though he were peering hard to clearly focus Beautiful eyes but frightening ones It seemed to me that I could never meet them without feeling nervous She could look right into youif you know what I mean
	Actually I dont said Wyler
	Fisher paid no attention She always knew when you were lying or hiding the truth You couldnt be silent without her guessing what the trouble was
	Youre not going to tell me she was a telepath
	What Oh no She used to say she read expressions and listened to intonations She said no one could hide what they were thinking No matter how you laughed you could not hide the tragic undercurrent no smile sufficed to hide bitterness She tried to explain but I could never grasp what it was she did She was something special Garand I was in awe of her And then my child was born Marlene
	Yes
	She had the same eyes
	The baby had your sisters eyes
	Not immediately but I watched them develop When she was six months old those eyes made me flinch
	Your wife flinched too
	I never noticed her being affected but then she never had a sister Roseanne Marlene hardly cried at all she was peaceful I remember Roseanne was like that as a baby And Marlene didnt show any signs that she was going to be particularly pretty either It was as though Roseanne had come back to me So you see how hard it turned out to be
	Coming back to Earth you mean
	Doing that and leaving them behind It was like losing Roseanne a second time Ill never see her now Never
	But you came back anyway
	Loyalty Duty But if you want the truth I almost didnt I was standing there torn Torn apart I was desperately wanting not to leave RoseanneMarlene You see I confuse the names And Eugeniamy wifesaid to me in a heartbroken way If you knew where we were going you wouldnt be so ready to turn back And at that moment I didnt want to leave I asked her to come to Earth with me She refused I asked her to let me take RoMarlene at least She refused And then when I might have given in and stayed she went wild and ordered me out And I went
	Wyler stared at Fisher reflectively  If you knew where we were going you wouldnt be so ready to turn back Is that what she said
	Yes thats what she said And when I said Why Where is Rotor going she said To the stars 
	That cant be right Crile You knew they were planning to go to the stars but she said If you knew where we were going There was something you didnt know What was it you didnt know
	What are you talking about How can anyone know what he doesnt know
	Wyler shrugged it off Did you tell this to the Office during the debriefing
	Fisher considered I guess not I didnt even think of it till I started telling you the story about how I nearly stayed He closed his eyes then said slowly No this is the first time Ive talked about that Its the first time Ive let myself think about it
	Very well then Now that you think about itwhere was Rotor going Did you hear any speculations on Rotor about that Any rumors Any guesses
	The assumption was that it would be to Alpha Centauri Where else Its the nearest star
	Your wife was an astronomer What did she say about it
	Nothing She never discussed it
	Rotor sent out the Far Probe
	I know
	And your wife was involvedas an astronomer
	She was but she never discussed it either and I was careful not to do so My mission would have been aborted and perhaps I might have been imprisonedor executed for all I knowif I displayed an unhealthy curiosity too openly
	But as an astronomer she would know the destination She as much as said so If you knew You see She knew and if you knew too
	Fisher didnt seem interested Since she didnt tell me what she knew I cant tell you
	Are you sure No casual remarks whose significance you didnt note at the time After all youre not an astronomer and she might have said something you didnt quite get Do you remember anything at all she said that set you to puzzling
	I cant think of anything
	Think Is it possible that the Far Probe located a planetary system around one or both of the Sunlike stars of Alpha Centauri
	I cant say
	Or planets about any star Fisher shrugged
	Think said Wyler urgently Is there any reason for you to think that she meant You think were going to Alpha Centauri but there are planets circling it and were heading for those Or could she have meant You think were going to Alpha Centauri but were going to another star where were sure there will be a useful planet Something like that
	I couldnt possibly guess
	Garand Wylers generous lips compressed themselves tightly for a moment Then he said Ill tell you what Crile my old friend There are three things that are going to happen now First youre going to have to undergo another debriefing Second I suspect were going to have to persuade the Ceres Settlement to allow us the use of their asteroid telescope and use it to inspect very closely every star within a hundred lightyears of the Solar System And third well have to whip our hyperspatialists into jumping a little higher and farther You watch and see if thats not what happens


Nine Erythro


	There were times once in a while once in an ever longer while as the years passed or so it seemed to him when Janus Pitt found time to sit back in his chair alone and silent and just allow his mind to relax Those were moments when there were no orders to give no information to absorb no immediate decisions to make no farms to visit no factories to inspect no regions in space to penetrate no one to see no one to listen to no one to foil no one to encourage
	And always when such times came Pitt allowed himself the final and least exhaustible luxurythat of selfpity
	It was not that he would have anything different than what it was He had planned for all his adult life to be Commissioner because he thought that no one could run Rotor as he could and now that he was Commissioner he still thought so
	But why among all the fools of Rotor could he find no one who could see longrange as he could It was fourteen years since the Leaving and still no one could really see the inevitable not even after he had explained it carefully
	Someday back in the Solar System sooner rather than later someone would develop hyperassistance as the hyperspatialists on Rotor hadperhaps even in a better form Someday humanity would set out in its hundreds and thousands of Settlements in its millions and billions of people to colonize the Galaxy and that would be a brutal time
	Yes the Galaxy was enormous How often had he heard that And beyond it were other galaxies But humanity would not spread out evenly Always always there would be some star systems that for one reason or another were better than other star systems and they would be the ones snarled and fought over If there were ten star systems and ten colonizing groups all ten would zero in on one of the star systems and one only
	And sooner or later they would discover N emesis and the colonizers would appear How would Rotor survive then
	Only if Rotor gained as much time as possible built up a strong civilization and expanded reasonably If they had enough time they might expand their hold over a group of stars If not Nemesis alone would be enoughbut it must be made impregnable
	Pitt did not dream of universal conquest of conquest of any kind What he wanted was an island of tranquility and security against the days when the Galaxy would be aflame and in chaos as a result of conflicting ambitions
	But he alone could see this He alone bore the weight of it He might live another quarter century and might remain in power through all that time either as actual Commissioner or as an elder statesman whose word would be decisive Yet eventually he would dieand to whom could he then bequeath his farsightedness
	Then Pitt felt a twinge of selfpity He had labored for so many years would labor for so many more yet was appreciatedtruly appreciatedby none And it would all come to an end anyway because the Idea would be drowned in the ocean of mediocrity that constantly lapped at the ankles of those few who could see beyond the years
	It was fourteen years since the Leaving and when at any time had he been able to be quietly confident He went to sleep each night with the fear that he would be awakened before morning with the news that another Settlement had arrivedthat Nemesis had been found 
	He passed through every day with some hidden part of him paying no attention to what was immediately on the agenda but listeninglistening for the fatal words
	Fourteen years and they were still not safe One additional settlement had been builtNew Rotor There were people living on it but it was a new world of course It still smelled of paint as the old saying had it Three more Settlements were in various stages of construction
	Soonwithin the decade at any ratethe number of Settlements under construction would increase and they would be given that oldest of all commands Be fruitful and multiply
	With the example of Earth before them with the knowledge that each Settlement had a narrow and unexpandable capacity procreation had always been under strict control in space There the immovable needs of arithmetic met the possibly irresistible force of instinct and immovability won But as the number of Settlements grew there would come a time when more people would be neededmany moreand the urge to produce them could be unleashed
	It would be temporary of course No matter how many Settlements there were they could be filled without effort by any population that could easily double its numbers every thirtyfive years or less And when the day came when the rate of Settlement formation passed through its inflection point and began to diminish it might be far harder to stuff the djinn back into its bottle than it had been to release it
	Who would see this well in advance and prepare for it once Pitt himself was gone
	And there was Erythro the planet that Rotor orbited in such a way that huge Megas and ruddy Nemesis rose and set in an intricate pattern Erythro That had been a question from the beginning
	Pitt remembered well the early days of their entry into the Nemesian System The limited intricacy of the planetary family of Nemesis had exposed itself little by little as Rotor raced toward the red dwarf star
	Megas had been discovered at a distance of four million kilometers from Nemesis only one fifteenth the distance of Mercury from the Sun of the Solar System Megas obtained about the same amount of energy as Earth got from its Sun but with a lesser intensity of visible light and a higher intensity of infrared
	Megas however was clearly not habitable even at first glance It was a gas giant with one side always facing Nemesis Both its rotation and revolution were twenty days long The perpetual night on half of Megas cooled it only moderately since its own interior heat rose to the surface The perpetual day on the other half was unendurably hot That Megas kept its atmosphere under this heat was entirely because with its mass higher and its radius smaller than that of Jupiter its surface gravity was fifteen times that of Jupiter and forty times that of Earth
	Nor did Nemesis have any other sizable planet But then as Rotor drew closer and Megas could be seen more clearly the situation was altered again
	It was Eugenia Insigna who brought Pitt the news It was not that she had made the discovery herself It had merely showed up on the computerenhanced photographs and had been brought to Insignas attention since she was Chief Astronomer With considerable excitement she had brought it to Pitt in his Commissioners chambers
	She had begun simply enough keeping her voice level though it was shaking with emotion
	Megas has a satellite she said Pitt had lifted his eyebrows ever so slightly but then he said Isnt that to be expected The gas giants of the Solar System have anywhere up to a score of satellites
	Of course Janus but this is not an ordinary satellite Its large Pitt kept his cool Jupiter has four large satellites
	I mean really large with almost Earths size and mass
	I see Interesting
	More than that Much more than that Janus If this satellite revolved about Nemesis directly tidal influences would cause only one side to face Nemesis and it would be uninhabitable Instead only one side faces Megas which is much cooler than Nemesis Furthermore the satellites orbit is tilted substantially to Megas equator This means that in the satellites sky Megas is seen from only one hemisphere and it moves north and south with a cycle of about one day while Nemesis moves across the sky rising and setting again with a cycle of one day One hemisphere has twelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light The other hemisphere has the same but during its daytime Nemesis is frequently in eclipse for up to half an hour at a time with the cooling made up for by Megas mild warmth During the dark hours in that hemisphere the darkness is ameliorated by Megas reflected light
	The satellite has an interesting sky then How fascinating for astronomers
	Its not just an astronomical lollipop Janus Its possible that the satellite has an equable temperature at the right range for human beings It may be a habitable world
	Pitt smiled Even more interesting but it wouldnt have our kind of light though would it
	Insigna nodded Thats true enough It would have a ruddy sun and a dark sky because there would be no shortwave light to be scattered And there would be a reddish landscape I suppose
	In that case since you named Nemesis and one of your people named Megas Ill take the privilege of naming the satellite Call it Erythro which if I recall correctly is related to the Greek word for red 
	The news remained good for quite some time thereafter An asteroid belt of respectable size was located beyond the orbit of the MegasErythro system and those asteroids would clearly be an ideal source of material for building more Settlements
	And as they approached Erythro the nature of its habitability seem to grow ever more favorable Erythro was a planet of sea and land though its seas from preliminary estimates of its cloud cover as made out in visible light and the infrared seemed shallower than Earths oceans and really impressive mountains on the land were very few Insigna on the basis of further calculations insisted that the climate on the planet as a whole would be entirely suitable for human life
	And then when the inflight had brought them to a distance from which Erythros atmosphere could be studied spectroscopically with precision Insigna said to him Erythros atmosphere is a little denser than Earths and it contains free oxygen percent of it plus  percent argon and the rest nitrogen There must be small quantities of carbon dioxide but we havent detected it yet The point is its a breathable atmosphere
	Sounds better and better said Pitt Who could have imagined this when you first spotted Nemesis
	Better and better for the biologist Maybe not very good for Rotor on the whole though A sizable content of free oxygen in the atmosphere is a sure indication of the presence of life
	Life said Pitt momentarily stupefied at the thought
	Life said Insigna boring in taking an apparent perverse pleasure in stressing the possibilities  And if life then possibly intelligent life perhaps even a high civilization
	What followed was a nightmare for Pitt He had not only to live with the terrible apprehension of his own Earthpeople pursuing and overtaking him superior in number certainly and in technology possibly but there was an accompanying fear now that was if anything greater They might be approaching and infringing on an old and advanced civilization capable of eradicating them in a moment of absentminded annoyance as a human being might without thinking crush a mosquito that buzzed too near his ear
	As they continued to approach Nemesis Pitt said to Insigna with a deeply troubled air Need oxygen truly imply the existence of life
	Its a thermodynamic inevitability Janus In an Earthlike planet and as nearly as we can tell Erythro is Earthlikefree oxygen cannot exist any more than in any Earthlike gravitational field a rock can be suspended in open air of its own accord Oxygen if present in the atmosphere to begin with would spontaneously combine with other elements in the soil giving off energy It would only continue to exist in the atmosphere if some process were to supply energy and continually regenerate free oxygen
	I understand that Eugenia but why need the energysupply process necessarily involve life
	Because nothing has ever been encountered in nature that would do the job except the photosynthetic action of green plants that make use of solar energy to release oxygen
	When you say nothing has ever been encountered in nature you mean in the Solar System This is another system with a different sun and a different planet under different conditions The laws of thermodynamics may still hold but what if there is some chemical process that we havent encountered in the Solar System and that is forming the oxygen here
	If youre a betting man said Insigna dont bet on it What was needed was evidence and Pitt had to wait for the evidence to appear
	To begin with Nemesis and Megas turned out to have extremely weak magnetic fields This created no particular stir for it had been expected since both star and planet rotated very slowly Erythro with a rotational period of twentythree hours and sixteen minutes equal to the period of its revolution about Megas had a magnetic field that was similar in intensity to Earths
	Insigna expressed her satisfaction At least we dont have to worry about dangerous radiation effects from intense magnetic fields especially since Nemesis stellar wind is bound to be much less intense than that of the Sun Thats good because it means we might be able to detect the presence or absence of life on Erythro at a distance Technological life anyway
	Whys that asked Pitt Its not at all likely that a high level of technology can be reached without copious use of radiowave radiation which would be speeding away from Erythro in all directions We ought to be able to differentiate between it and any random radiowave radiation from the planet itself when such natural radiation is minor considering that its magnetic field is weak
	Pitt said Ive been thinking that this may not be necessary that we can reason out Erythros lifelessness even though it does have an oxygen atmosphere
	Oh Id like to hear how that might be done
	Ive thought this out Listen Didnt you say that tidal influences slow the rotations of Nemesis Megas and Erythro And didnt you say that as a result Megas has moved farther from Nemesis and Erythro has moved farther from Megas
	Yes
	Therefore if we look into the past Megas was once closer to Nemesis and Erythro was closer to Megas and to Nemesis too That means that Erythro was far too warm for life to begin with and may only have become hospitable to life recently There might not have been enough time for a technological civilization to develop
	Insigna laughed gently Good point I mustnt underestimate your astronomical ingenuitybut not good enough Red dwarf stars have a long life and Nemesis might easily have been formed in the very youth of the Universesay fifteen billion years ago The tidal influence would have been very strong at first when the bodies were closer together and most of the driving apart may have taken place in the first three or four billion years The tidal influence decreases as the cube of the distance and in the last ten billion years or so there would not have been much change and that would be plenty of time for several technological civilizations to be built up one after the other No Janus lets not speculate Lets wait and see if we can detect radiowave radiation or not
	Closer still to Nemesis
	It was a tiny red orb now to the unaided eye but its dimness could be looked at without trouble To one side Megas was visible as a ruddy dot In the telescope it showed at something less than halfphase as a result of the angle it made with Rotor and with Nemesis Erythro could be made out in the telescope too as a dimmer crimson dot
	It grew brighter with time and Insigna said Its good news for you Janus No suspicious radiowave radiation of possibly technological origin has yet been detected
	Wonderful Pitt felt the wave of relief as though it were a physical warmth washing over him
	Dont leap though said Insigna They might use less radiowave radiation that we might expect They might shield it very well They might even use something else in place of radio waves
	Pitts mouth quirked into a small halfsmile  Are you suggesting that seriously
	Insigna shrugged uncertainly
	Pitt said Because if youre a betting woman dont bet on it Closer still to Nemesis and Erythro was now a large orb to the unaided eye with bloated Megas near it and Nemesis on the other side of the Settlement Rotor had adjusted its velocity to keep pace with Erythro which through the telescope showed drifting broken clouds in the familiar spiral shapes of a planet of Earthtype temperature and atmosphere and therefore it should be counted on as possessing an at least vaguely Earthlike climate
	Insigna said There are no signs of light on the nightside of Erythro That should please you Janus
	The absence of light is not consistent with a technological civilization I suppose
	It certainly isnt 
	Let me play devils advocate then said Pitt With a red sun and dim light wouldnt a civilization produce a dim artificial light as well
	It might be dim in the visible region but Nemesis is rich in the infrared and we would expect artificial light to be similarly rich
	What infrared we detect however is planetary It appears more or less equally over the entire land surface whereas artificial light would have patterns coming off richly in population concentrations sparsely elsewhere
	Then forget it Eugenia said Pitt buoyantly There is no technological civilization It might make Erythro less interesting in some ways but you cant want us to face our equals or perhaps our superiors We would have to leave and go elsewhere and we have nowhere else to go and perhaps an insufficient energy supply to get there if we did As it is we can stay
	Theres still copious oxygen in the atmosphere so theres still certain to be life on Erythro Its only a technological civilization thats lacking It means well have to go down and study its lifeforms
	Why
	How can you ask Janus If we have another sample of life here one that is altogether independent of the life developed on Earth what a bonanza it would be for our biologists
	I see Youre talking about scientific curiosity Well the lifeforms wont go away I suppose There will be time enough for that later First things first
	What can come ahead of a study of a totally new form of life
	Eugenia be reasonable We must establish ourselves here We must build other Settlements We must create a large and wellordered society one far more homogeneous selfunderstanding and peaceful than ever existed in the Solar System
	For that well need material supplies which takes us down to Erythro again where well have to study the lifeforms
	No Eugenia To land on Erythro and to take off again in the face of its gravitational field would be too costly at the present moment The intensity of the gravitational fields of Erythro and of Megasdont forget Megasis great enough even out here in space One of our people calculated it for me Well have a problem getting our supplies even from the asteroid belt but it will be less of a problem than getting them from Erythro In fact if we station ourselves in the asteroid belt matters would be even more priceeffective The asteroid belt will be where we build our Settlements
	Are you proposing to ignore Erythro
	For a while Eugenia When we are strong when our energy supply is much greater when our society is stable and growing time enough then to investigate Erythros lifeforms or perhaps its unusual chemistry
	Pitt smiled soothingly understandably at Insigna The side issue of Erythro he knew had to be delayed as long as possible If it bore no technological society then whatever other lifeforms and resources it had could wait The pursuing hordes from the Solar System were the true enemy
	Why couldnt others see what had to be done Why were others so easily diverted into useless side paths
	How would he ever dare to die and leave the fools unprotected


Ten Persuasion


	So now twelve years after the discovery that no technological civilization existed on Erythro and twelve years during which no Settlements from Earth had suddenly appeared to ruin the new world that was gradually being constructed Pitt could appreciate these rare moments of rest And yet even in these rare moments doubts crept in He wondered whether Rotor would not have been better off if he had clung to that original resolve of hisif they had not remained in orbit about Erythro and if the Dome on Erythro had never been built
	He was leaning back in his soft chair the restraining fields cushioning him the aura of peace lulling him almost into sleep when he heard the soft buzz that drew him back reluctantly into reality
	He opened his eyes he had not realized they were closed to look at the small viewpatch on the opposite wall A touch of a contact magnified it into holovision
	It was Semyon Akorat of course
	There he was with his bald bullethead Akorat shaved off the dark fringe that would otherwise show feeling quite rightly that a few fugitive hairs would but make the desert in the center look the more pathetic whereas a shapely skull unmarred by interruption could look almost stately There he was also with his worried eyes which always looked worried even when there was no cause for worry
	Pitt found him unpleasant not because of any failure in loyalty or efficiency he could not be improved on either way but simply because of conditioned response Akorat always announced an invasion of Pitts privacy an interruption of his thoughts a necessity for doing what he would rather not do In short Akorat was in charge of Pitts appointments and said who could see him and who could not
	Pitt frowned slightly He could not recall that he had an appointment but he often forgot and relied on Akorat not to
	Who is it he said resignedly No one important I hope
	No one at all of any real significance said Akorat but perhaps you had better see her
	Is she within earshot
	Commissioner said Akorat reproachfully as though he were being accused of dereliction of duty Of course not She is on the other side of the screen He had an enormous precision of speech which Pitt found soothing There was never any question of mistaking his words
	Pitt said She I presume it Dr Insigna then Well stick to my instructions Not without an appointment Ive had enough of her for a while Akorat Enough of her for the last twelve years in fact Make up an excuse Say Im in meditationno she wont believe thatsay
	Commissioner its not Dr Insigna I would not have disturbed you if it were Itsits her daughter
	Her daughter For a moment he fumbled over her name You mean Marlene Fisher
	Yes Naturally I told her you were busy and she said that I ought to be ashamed of myself for telling a lie for my expression showed it was a lie up and down and that my voice was too tense to be telling the truth He recited this with baritone indignation In any case she wont leave She insists you will see her if you know she is waiting Would you see her Commissioner Those eyes of hers rattle me frankly
	It seems to me Ive heard of her eyes too Well send her in send her in and Ill try to survive her eyes Come to think of it she has some explaining to do
	She entered Remarkably selfpossessed Pitt thought though properly demure and with no sign of defiance
	She sat down her hands loosely in her lap and clearly waited for Pitt to speak first He let her wait a little while he considered her in a rather absent fashion He had seen her occasionally when she was younger but not for a while now She had not been a pretty child and she wasnt any prettier now She had broad cheekbones and a certain gracelessness about her but she did have remarkable eyes and shapely eyebrows and long eyelashes too
	Pitt said Well Miss Fisher Im told you wanted to see me May I ask why
	Marlene looked up at him her eyes cool and seemed entirely at ease She said Commissioner Pitt I think my mother must have told you that I told a friend of mine that the Earth was going to be destroyed
	Pitts eyebrows hunched down over his own rather ordinary eyes He said Yes she did And I hope she told you that you must not speak of such matters in so foolish a way again
	Yes she did Commissioner but not speaking about it doesnt mean it isnt so and calling it foolish doesnt make it so
	I am Commissioner of Rotor Miss Fisher and it is my function to concern myself with such matters and therefore you must leave it entirely to me whether it is so or not so whether it is foolish or not foolish How did you get the idea that the Earth was going to be destroyed Is this something your mother told you
	Not directly Commissioner
	But indirectly Is that it
	She couldnt help that Commissioner Everyone speaks in all sorts of ways Theres the choice of words Theres intonation expression the flicker of eyes and eyelids little tricks of clearing the throat A hundred things Do you know what I mean
	I know exactly what you mean I watch for those things myself
	And you feel very proud of that Commissioner You feel youre very good at it and that thats one of the reasons youre Commissioner
	Pitt looked startled I didnt say that young woman
	Not in words Commissioner You didnt have to Her eyes were fixed on his There was no trace of a smile on her face but her eyes seemed amused
	Well then Miss Fisher is that what you came to tell me
	No Commissioner I came because my mother has found it difficult to see you recently No she didnt tell me so I just gathered it I thought you might see me instead
	All right youre here Now what is it you came to tell me
	My mother is unhappy about the chance that Earth may be destroyed My fathers there you know
	Pitt felt a small spasm of anger How could a purely personal matter be allowed to interfere with the welfare of Rotor and all that it might become in the future This Insigna for all her usefulness in having found Nemesis in the first place had long been an albatross about his neck with her unfailing way of heading down every wrong path And now when he would see her no more she sent her mad daughter
	He said  Are you under the impression that this destruction you speak of will happen tomorrow or next year
	No Commissioner I know that it will happen in just a little bit less than five thousand years
	If that is the case your father will be long gone by then as will your mother and I and you And when were all gone it will still be nearly five thousand years before destruction for Earth and possibly other planets of the Solar Systemif that destruction happens at all which it wont
	Its the idea of it Commissioner whenever it happens
	Your mother must have told you that long before the time comes the people of the Solar System will be aware ofof whatever you think will happen and will deal with it Besides how can we complain of planetary destruction Every world faces it eventually Even if there are no cosmic collisions every star must pass through a red giant stage and destroy its planets Just as all human beings will die someday so will all planets Planetary lifetimes are a little longer but thats all Do you understand all that young lady
	Yes I do said Marlene seriously I have a good relationship with my computer
	Ill bet she does thought Pitt and thentoo latetried to wipe out the small sardonic smile that had twitched into existence on his face She had probably used it to understand his attitude
	He said with a note of finality Then we come to the end of our conversation The talk of destruction is foolish and even if it werent it has nothing to do with you and you must never speak of it again or not only you but your mother as well will be in trouble
	Were not at the end of our conversation yet Commissioner
	Pitt felt himself losing patience but he said quite calmly My dear Miss Fisher when your Commissioner says its the end it isregardless of what you think
	He halfrose but Marlene sat where she was Because I want to offer you something you would dearly like to have
	What 
	The good riddance of my mother
	Pitt sank back into his chair truly puzzled What do you mean by that
	If you will listen to me Commissioner I will tell you My mother cant live like this Shes concerned about Earth and the Solar System andand she thinks about my father sometimes She thinks that Nemesis may be the nemesis of the Solar System and since she gave it the name she feels responsible Shes an emotional person commissioner
	Yes Youve noticed that have you
	And she bothers you She reminds you every once in a while about matters that she feels strongly about and you dont want to hear about and so you refuse to see her and you wish shed go away You can send her away Commissioner
	Indeed Weve got one other Settlement Shall I send her to New Rotor
	No Commissioner Send her to Erythro
	Erythro But why should I send her there Just because I want to get rid of her
	That would be your reason Yes Commissioner It would not be my reason though I want her on Erythro because she cant really work at the Observatory The instruments always seem to be in use and she feels shes being watched all the time She feels your annoyance And besides Rotor isnt a good base for delicate measurements It turns too rapidly and too unevenly for good measurements
	You have it all at your fingertips Did your mother explain this to you No you dont have to tell me She didnt tell you directly did she Only indirectly
	Yes Commissioner And theres my computer
	The one you have friendly relations with
	Yes Commissioner
	And so you think she will be able to work better on Erythro
	Yes Commissioner It will be a stabler base and she might make the kind of measurements that will convince her that the Solar System will survive Even if she finds out otherwise it will take a long time for her to be sure of that and for that time at least youll be rid of her
	I see that you want to be rid of her too is that it
	Not at all Commissioner said Marlene with composure I would go with her Youd be rid of me too which would please you even more than being rid of her
	What makes you think I want to get rid of you too
	Marlene fixed her gaze on him somber unblinking Now you do Commissioner since you now know that I have no trouble in interpreting your inner feelings
	Suddenly Pitt found himself desperately wanting to get rid of this monster He said Let me think about this and turned his head He felt that he was being childish in looking away but he did not want this horrible youngster to read his face like the open book it was
	It was after all the truth He did now want to get rid of mother and daughter alike Where the mother was concerned he had indeed thought on several occasions of exiling her to Erythro But since she would scarcely have wanted to go there would have been a most unappetizing fuss and he had no stomach for that Now though her daughter had given him a reason why she might indeed want to go to Erythro and that of course changed things
	He said slowly If your mother really wants this
	She really does Commissioner She hasnt mentioned it to me and it may be she hasnt even thought of it yet but she will want to go I know that Trust me
	Do I have a choice And do you want to go
	Very much Commissioner
	Then I will arrange for it at once Does that satisfy you
	Yes it does Commissioner
	Then shall we now consider the interview at an end
	Marlene rose and ducked her head in a graceless bow presumably one that was intended to be respectful Thank you Commissioner
	She turned and left and it wasnt till she had been gone for several minutes that Pitt dared unclench the grip that had kept his face in place till it was aching
	He dared not have allowed her to deduce from anything he said or did or seemed the final item that he and only one other person knew about Erythro


Eleven Orbit


	Pitts quiet time was over but he did not wish it to be over Quite arbitrarily he canceled his afternoon appointments He wanted more thinking time
	Specifically he wanted to think about Marlene Her mother Eugenia Insigna Fisher was a problem and had in fact grown to be more of one over the last dozen years She was emotional and jumped far ahead of anything reason would allow Yet she was a human being she could be led and controlled she could be pentup within the comfortable walls of logic and though she might be restless at times she could be made to remain there
	Not so with this Marlene Pitt had no doubt that she was a monster and he could only be grateful that she had foolishly revealed herself in order to help her mother on so trivial an occasion But then she was inexperienced and lacked the wisdom to have kept her abilities hidden until she could use them in a truly devastating fashion
	But she would only grow more dangerous as she grew older so she would have to be stopped now And she would be stopped by that other monster Erythro
	Pitt gave himself credit He had recognized Erythro as a monster from the start It had its own expression to readthe reflection of the bloody light of its star an expression that was ominous and menacing
	When they had reached the asteroid belt a hundred million miles outside the orbit in which Megas and Erythro circled Nemesis Pitt had said with full confidence This is the place
	He had expected no difficulty The rational view admitted nothing else Among the asteroids Nemesis cast little heat and light The loss of natural heat and light was nothing since Rotor had fully functional microfusion In fact it was actually a benefit With its red light dimmed to almost nothing it did not weigh down the heart darken the mind and shiver the soul
	Then too a base in the asteroidal belt would place them in an area where the gravitational effects of Nemesis and Megas would be weak and where maneuverability would in consequence be less energyexpensive The asteroids would be more easily mined and considering the feeble light of Nemesis there should be plenty of volatiles on those little bodies
	Ideal And yet the people of Rotor made it clear that by an overwhelming majority they wanted to move the Settlement into orbit around Erythro Pitt labored to point out that they would be bathed in angrily depressing red light that they would be held firmly in the grip of Megas as well as Erythro and that they might still have to go to the asteroids for raw materials
	Pitt discussed it angrily with Tambor Brossen the exCommissioner to whose post he had succeeded The rather weary Brossen openly enjoyed his new role as elder statesman far more than he had ever enjoyed being Commissioner He had been known to say that he lacked Pitts pleasure in making decisions
	Brossen had laughed at Pitts concern over the matter of Settlement locationnot outright to be sure but gently with his eyes He said Theres no need Janus to feel that you must educate Rotor into absolute agreement with you Let the Settlement have its own way once in a while they will be all the readier to let you have your way at other times If they want to orbit Erythro let them orbit Erythro
	But it makes no sense Tambor Dont you understand that
	Of course I understand that I also understand that Rotor has been in orbit around a sizable world all its existence Thats what seems right to Rotorians and thats what they want to have again
	We were in orbit about Earth Erythro is not Earth it is nothing like Earth
	It is a world and is about the same size as Earth It has land and sea It has an atmosphere with oxygen in it We could travel thousands of lightyears before finding a world this much like Earth I tell you again Let the people have it
	Pitt had followed Brossens advice though something within him muttered dissension every step of the way New Rotor was also in orbit around Erythro and so were the two others in process of construction Of course Settlements in the asteroid belt were on the drawing boards but the public clearly lacked eagerness to put them through
	Of all that had happened since the discovery of Nemesis it was this orbiting of Erythro that Pitt considered Rotors greatest mistake It should not have happened And yetand yetcould even he have forced it on Rotor Might he have tried harder And would that merely have led to a new election and his displacement
	It was nostalgia that was the great problem People tended to look back and Pitt could not always make them turn their head and look forward Consider Brossen
	He had died seven years ago and Pitt had been at his deathbed Pitt alone had happened to catch the old mans dying words Brossen had beckoned to Pitt who had leaned close to him Brossen had reached out a feeble hand the skin dry as paper Clutching feebly at Pitt he had whispered How bright the Sun of Earth was and had died
	So because Rotorians could not forget how bright the Sun had once been and how green the Earth had once been they cried out in exasperation against Pitts logic and demanded that Rotor orbit a world that was not green and that circled a sun that was not bright
	It meant the loss of ten years in the rate of progress They would have been ten years farther ahead had they been located in the asteroid belt from the start Pitt was convinced of that
	That alone was enough to poison Pitts feelings toward Erythro but there was in connection with it matters that were worsemuch worse


Twelve Anger


	As it happened Crile Fisher having given Earth its first hint that there was something peculiar about Rotors destination gave it its second hint as well
	He had been back on Earth two years now with Rotor growing dimmer in his mind Eugenia Insigna was a rather perplexing memory what had he felt for her but Marlene remained a bitterness He found he could not separate her from Roseanne in his mind The oneyearold daughter he remembered and the seventeenyearold sister he also remembered fused into one personality
	Life was not hard He drew a generous pension They had even found work for him to do an easy administrative position in which he was required to make decisions on occasion that were guaranteed to affect nothing of importance They had forgiven him at least in part he thought because he had remembered that one remark of Eugenias If you knew where we were going
	Yet he had the impression that he was kept under watch anyway and he had grown to resent it
	Garand Wyler appeared now and then always friendly always inquisitive always returning the subject to Rotor in one way or another He had in fact made his appearance now and the subject of Rotor came up as Fisher expected it would
	Fisher scowled and said Its been nearly two years What do you people want of me
	Wyler shook his head I cant say I know Crile All we have is that remark of your wifes Its obviously not enough She must have said something else in the years you spent with her Consider the conversations you have had the talk that bounced back and forth between the two of you Is there nothing there
	This is the fifth time youve asked that Garand I have been questioned I have been hypnotized I have been mindprobed I have been squeezed dry and there is nothing in me Let me go and find something else to tackle Or put me back to work There are a hundred Settlements out there with friends confiding in each other and enemies spying on each other Who knows what one of them may know and may not even know that he knows
	Wyler said To be truthful old man weve been moving in that direction and weve also been concentrating on the Far Probe It stands to reason that Rotor must have found something the rest of us dont know Weve never sent out a Far Probe Neither has any other Settlement Only Rotor had the capacity for it Whatever Rotor found must be in the Far Probe data
	Good Look through that data There must be enough there to keep you busy for years As for me leave me alone All of you
	Wyler said  As a matter of fact there is enough there to keep us busy for years Rotor supplied a great deal of data in line with the Open Science Agreement In particular we have their stellar photography at every range of wavelength The Far Probe cameras were able to reach almost every part of the sky and weve been studying it in detail and have found nothing in it of interest
	Nothing
	So far nothing but as you say we can continue to study it for years Of course we already have any number of items the astronomy people are delighted with It keeps them happy and busy but not a single item not the sniff of one seems to help us decide where they went Not so far I gather that there is absolutely nothing for instance to lead us to think that there are planets orbiting either large star of the Alpha Centauri system Nor are there are any unexpected Sunlike stars we dont know about in our neighborhood Personally I wouldnt expect to find much anyway What could the Far Probe see that we couldnt see from the Solar System It was only a couple of lightmonths away It should make no difference Yet some of us feel that Rotor must have seen something and rather quickly too Which brings us back to you
	Why me
	Because your exwife was the head of the Far Probe project
	Not really She became Chief Astronomer after the data had been collected
	She was the head afterward and certainly an important part during Did she never say anything to you about what they had found in the Far Probe
	Not a word Wait did you say that the Far Probe cameras were able to reach almost every part of the sky
	Yes
	How much is almost every part 
	Im not in their confidence to the point where I can give you exact figures I gather its at least  percent
	Or more
	Maybe more
	I wonder
	What do you wonder
	On Rotor we had a fellow named Pitt running things
	We know that
	But I think I know how he would do things He would hand out the Far Probe data a little at a time living up to the Open Science Agreement but just barely And somehow by the time Rotor left there would have been some of the data percent or lessthat he would not have had time to get to you And that would be the important  percent or less
	You mean the part that tells us where Rotor went
	Maybe
	Only we havent got it
	Sure you have it
	How do you make that out
	Just a little while ago you wondered why you should expect to see anything in the Far Probe photographs that you couldnt see in the Solar System records So why are you wasting your time on what they gave you Map out the part of the sky they didnt give you and study that part on your own maps Ask yourself if theres anything there that might look different on a Far Probe mapand why Thats what I would do His voice suddenly rose to a formidable shout You go back there Tell them to look at the part of the sky they dont have
	Wyler said thoughtfully Topsyturvy
	No it isnt Perfectly straightforward Just find someone in the Office who does more with his brain than sit on it and you may get somewhere
	Wyler said Well see He held out his hand to Fisher Fisher scowled and wouldnt take it
	It was months before Wyler made an appearance again and Fisher didnt welcome him He had been in a quiet mood on this offday from work and had even been reading a book
	Fisher was not one of those people who felt that a book was a twentiethcentury abomination that only viewing was civilized There was something he thought about holding a book about the physical turning of pages about the ability to lose ones self in thought over what one has read or even to drowse off without coming to and finding the film a hundred pages beyond or flickering at its close Fisher was rather of the opinion that the book was the more civilized of the two modes
	He was all the more annoyed at being roused out of his pleasant lethargy
	Now what Garand he said ungraciously
	Wyler did not lose his urbane smile He said between his teeth Weve found it just exactly as you said we would
	Found what said Fisher not remembering Then realizing what this must refer to he said hastily Dont tell me anything Im not supposed to know I wont be tangled with the Office anymore
	Too late Crile Youre wanted Tanayama himself wants you in front of him
	When
	As soon as I can get you there
	In that case tell me whats going on I dont want to face him cold
	Thats what I intend to do We studied every portion of the sky that the Far Probe did not report on Apparently those who did so asked themselves as you advised what it was that a Far Probe camera could see that a Solar System camera could not The obvious answer was a displacement of the nearer stars and once that was in their heads the astronomers found an astonishing thing something they couldnt have predicted
	Well
	They found a very dim star with a parallax of well over one second of arc
	Im not an astronomer Is that unusual
	It means that the star is at only half the distance of Alpha Centauri
	You said very dim 
	Its behind a small dust cloud they tell me Listen if youre not an astronomer your wife on Rotor was Perhaps she discovered it Did she ever say anything to you about it
	Fisher shook his head Not a word Of course
	Yes
	In the last few months there was an excitement about her A kind of brimming over
	You didnt ask why
	I assumed it was the imminent departure of Rotor She was excited about going and that drove me mad
	On account of your daughter Fisher nodded
	The excitement may have been over the new star too It all fits Naturally theyd go to this new star And if your wife had discovered it they would be going to her star That would account for some of her eagerness to go Doesnt it make sense
	Maybe I cant say it doesnt
	All right then Thats what Tanayama wants to see you about And hes angry Not at you apparently but hes angry

	It was later that same day for there was no delay on this occasion that Crile Fisher found himself in the office of the Terrestrial Board of Inquiry or as it was far better known to its employees simply the Office
	Kattimoro Tanayama who had directed the Office for over thirty years was getting quite elderly The holographs shown of him there werent many had been recorded years before when his hair was still smooth and black his body straight his expression vigorous
	Now his hair was gray his body never tall was slightly bent and possessed an air of frailty He might thought Fisher be reaching the point where he was considering retiring if it were conceivable that he intended to do anything but die in harness His eyes Fisher noted were between their narrowed lids as keen and as sharp as ever
	Fisher had a little trouble understanding him English was as nearly universal a language on Earth as it was possible for a language to be but it had its varieties and Tanayamas was not the North American variety Fisher was accustomed to
	Tanayama said coldly Well Fisher you failed us on Rotor Fisher saw no point in arguing the matter and no point in arguing with Tanayama in any case
	Yes Director he said tonelessly
	Yet you may still have information for us
	Fisher sighed silently then said I have been debriefed over and over
	So I have been told and so I know You have not been asked everything however and I have a question to which IIwant an answer
	Yes Director
	In your stay on Rotor have you been aware of anything that would lead you to believe that the Rotorian leadership hated Earth
	Fishers eyebrows climbed Hate It was clear to me that the people on Rotor as on all Settlements I think looked down on Earth despised it as decadent brutal and violent But hatred I dont think they thought enough of us frankly to feel hatred
	I talk of the leadership not of the multitude
	So do I Director No hatred
	Theres no other way of accounting for it
	 Accounting for what Director If that is a question I may ask Tanayama looked up at him sharply the force of his personality made one rarely aware of just how short he was Do you know that this new star is moving in our direction Quite in our direction
	Fisher startled looked quickly toward Wyler but Wyler sat in comparative shadow well out of range of the sunlight from the window and was not in appearance looking at anything
	Tanayama who was standing said Well sit down Fisher if it will help you think I will sit down too He sat down on the edge of his desk his short legs dangling
	Did you know about the motion of the star
	No Director I didnt know of the existence of the star at all till Agent Wyler told me
	You didnt Surely it was known on Rotor
	If so no one told me
	Your wife was excited and happy in the last period before Rotor left So you told Agent Wyler What was the reason
	Agent Wyler had thought it might be because she had discovered the star
	And perhaps she knew of the stars motion and was pleased at the thought of what would happen to us
	I cant see why that thought should make her happy Director I must tell you that I do not actually know that she knew of the stars motion or even that it existed I do not of my own knowledge know that anyone on Rotor knew that the star existed
	Tanayama looked at him thoughtfully rubbing one side of his chin lightly as though relieving a slight itch
	He said The people on Rotor were all Euros I believe werent they
	Fishers eyes widened He hadnt heard that vulgarism in a long timenever from a government functionary He remembered Wylers comment soon after he had returned to Earth about Rotor being Snow White He had dismissed it as a piece of lighthearted sarcasm and had given no heed to it
	He said resentfully I dont know Director I didnt study them all I dont know what their ancestries may be
	Come Fisher You dont have to study them Judge by their appearances In all your stay on Rotor did you encounter one face that was Afro or Mongo or Hindo Did you encounter a dark complexion An epicanthic fold
	Fisher exploded Director youre being twentiethcentury If he had known a stronger way of putting it he would have I dont give these things thought and no one on Earth should Im surprised you do and I dont think it would help your position if it were known that you do
	Dont indulge in fairy tales Agent Fisher said the Director moving one gnarled finger from side to side in admonition I am talking about what is I know that on Earth we ignore all variation among ourselves at least outwardly
	Just outwardly said Fisher in indignation
	Just outwardly said Tanayama coldly When Earths people go out to the Settlements they sort themselves out by variation Why should they do that if they ignored all variation On any Settlement all are alike or if there is some admixture to begin with those who are well outnumbered feel illatease or are made to feel illatease and shift to another Settlement where they are not outnumbered Isnt that so
	Fisher found he could not deny this It was so and he had somehow taken it for granted without questioning it He said Human nature Like clings to like It set up aneighborhood
	Human nature of course Like clings to like because like hates and despises unlike
	There are MMongo Settlements too Fisher stumbled over the word and realized full well that he might be mortally offending the Directoran easy and dangerous man to offend
	Tanayama did not blink I know that well but its the Euros who most recently dominated the planet and they cannot forget it can they
	The others perhaps cannot forget that either and they have more cause to hate
	But its Rotor that went flying off to escape from the Solar System
	It happened to be they who had discovered hyperassistance
	And they went to a nearby star that only they knew of one which is heading toward our Solar System and may pass closely enough to disrupt it
	We dont know they know that or that they even know the star
	Of course they know it said Tanayama with what was almost a snarl And they left without warning us
	Directorwith respectthis is illogical If they are going to establish themselves on a star that will on its approach disrupt our Solar System the stars own system will also be disrupted
	They can easily escape even if they build more Settlements We have an entire world of eight billion people to evacuatea much more difficult task
	How much time do we have
	Tanayama shrugged Several thousand years they tell me
	Thats a great deal of time It might not have occurred to them just conceivably that it was necessary to warn us As the star approaches it will surely be discovered without warning
	And by that time we will have less time to evacuate Their discovery of the star was accidental We would not have discovered it for a long time but for your wifes indiscreet remark to you and but for your suggestiona good onethat we look closely at the part of the sky that had been omitted Rotor was counting on our discovery being as belated as possible
	But Director why should they want such a thing Sheer motiveless hate
	Not motiveless So that the Solar System with its heavy load of nonEuros might be destroyed So that humanity can make a new start on a homogenous basis of Euros only Eh What do you think of that
	Fisher shook his head helplessly Impossible Unthinkable
	Why else should they have failed to warn us
	Might it not be that they did not themselves know of the stars motion
	Impossible said Tanayama ironically Unthinkable There is no other reason for what they have done but their willingness to see us destroyed But we will discover hyperspatial travel for ourselves and we will move out to this new star and find them And we will even the score

	Eugenia Insigna greeted her daughters statement with a halflaugh of disbelief How does one go about doubting a young daughters sanity as an alternative to doubting ones own hearing capacity
	What did you say Marlene What do you mean Im going to Erythro
	I asked Commissioner Pitt and he said he would arrange it Insigna looked blank But why
	Betraying a bit of irritation Marlene answered Because you say you want to make delicate astronomical measurements and you cant do it delicately enough from Rotor You can do it from Erythro But I see Im not answering your real question
	Youre right What I meant was why should Commissioner Pitt have said he would arrange it Ive asked several times before this and he has always refused Hes unwilling to let anyone go to Erythro except for some specialists
	I just put it to him in a different way Mother Marlene hesitated a moment I told him that I knew he was anxious to get rid of you and this was his chance
	Insigna drew in her breath so sharply that she choked slightly and had to cough Then eyes watering she said How could you say that
	Because its true Mother I wouldnt have said it if it werent true Ive heard him speak to you and Ive heard you speak about him and its just so clear that I know you see it too Hes annoyed with you and wishes youd stop bothering him aboutabout whatever you bother him about You know that
	Insigna pressed her lips together and said You know darling Im going to have to take you into my confidence from now on It really embarrasses me to have you worm these things out
	I know Mother Marlenes eyes dropped Im sorry
	But I still dont understand You didnt have to explain to him that hes annoyed with me He must know he is Why then didnt he send me to Erythro when I asked him to do so in the past
	Because he hates having anything to do with Erythro and just getting rid of you wasnt enough to overcome his dislike of the world Only this time its not just you going Its you and I Both of us
	Insigna leaned forward placing her hands flat on the table between them No MollyMarlene Erythro is not the place for you I wont be there forever III take my measurements and come back and youll stay right here and wait for me
	Im afraid not Mother Its clear that hes only willing to let you go because thats the only way we can get rid of me Thats why he agreed to send you when I asked that we both go and wouldnt agree when you asked that just you go Do you see
	Insigna frowned No I dont I really dont What do you have to do with it
	When we were talking and I explained that I knew he would like to get rid of both of us his face frozeyou know so he could wipe out all expression He knew I could understand expressions and little things like that and he didnt want me to guess what he was feeling I suppose But thats also a giveaway you see and tells me a lot Besides you cant suppress everything Your eyes flicker and I guess you dont even know it
	So you knew he wanted to get rid of you too
	Worse than that Hes scared of me
	Why should he be scared of you
	I suppose because he hates having me know what he doesnt want me to know She added with a dour sigh Lots of people get upset with me for that
	Insigna nodded I can understand that You make people feel nakedmentally naked I mean like a cold wind is blowing across their minds
	Her eyes focused on her daughter Sometimes I feel that way myself Looking back I think youve disturbed me since you were a small child I told myself often enough that you were simply unusually intelli
	I think I am said Marlene quickly
	That too yes but it was clearly something more than that though I didnt see it very clearly Tell medo you mind talking about this
	Not to you Mother said Marlene but there was a note of caution in her voice
	Well then when you were younger and found out that you could do this and other children couldntand even other grownups couldntwhy didnt you come and tell me about it
	I tried once actually but you were impatient I mean you didnt say anything but I could tell you were busy and couldnt be bothered with childish nonsense
	Insignas eyes widened Did I say it was childish nonsense
	You didnt say it but the way you looked at me and the way you were holding your hands said it
	You should have insisted on telling me
	I was just a little kid And you were unhappy most of the timeabout Commissioner Pitt and about Father
	Never mind about that Is there anything else you can tell me now
	Theres only one thing said Marlene When Commissioner Pitt said we could go there was something about the way he said it that made me think he left out somethingthat there was something he didnt say
	And what was it Marlene
	Thats just it Mother I cant read minds so I dont know I can only go by outside things and that leaves things hazy sometimes Still
	Yes
	I have the feeling that whatever it was he didnt say was rather unpleasantmaybe even evil
	Getting ready for Erythro took Insigna quite a while of course There were matters on Rotor that could not be left at midpoint There had to be arrangements in the astronomy department instructions to others appointment of her chief associate to the position of Chief Astronomer protem and some final consultations with Pitt who was oddly noncommunicative on the matter
	Insigna finally put it to him during her last report before leaving Im going to Erythro tomorrow you know she said
	Pardon me He looked up from the final report she had handed him and which he had been staring at though she was convinced he wasnt reading it Was she picking up some of Marlenes tricks and not knowing how to handle it She mustnt begin to believe that she was penetrating below the surface when in fact she was not
	She said patiently Im going to Erythro tomorrow you know
	Is it tomorrow Well youll be coming back eventually so this is not goodbye Take care of yourself Look upon it as a vacation
	I intend to be working on Nemesis motion through space
	That Well He made a gesture with both hands as though pushing something unimportant away As you wish A change of surroundings is a vacation even if you continue working
	I want to thank you for allowing this Janus
	Your daughter asked me to Did you know she asked me to
	I know She told me the same day I told her she had no right to bother you You were very tolerant of her
	Pitt grunted Shes a very unusual girl I didnt mind obliging her Its only temporary Finish your calculations and return
	She thought Thats twice he mentioned my return What would Marlene make out of that if she were here Something evil as she says But what
	She said evenly Well come back
	He said With the news I hope that Nemesis will prove harmless five thousand years from now
	Thats for the facts to decide she said grimly then left

	It was strange Eugenia Insigna thought She was over two lightyears from the spot in space where she was born and yet she had only been on a spaceship twice and then for the shortest possible journeysfrom Rotor to Earth and then back to Rotor again
	She still had no great urge to travel in space It was Marlene who was the driving force behind this trip It was she who independently had seen Pitt and persuaded him to succumb to her strange form of blackmail And it was she who was truly excited with this odd compulsion of hers to visit Erythro Insigna could not understand that compulsion and viewed it as another part of her daughters unique mental and emotional complexity Still whenever Insigna quailed at the thought of leaving safe small comfortable Rotor for the vast empty world of Erythro so strange and menacing and fully six hundred and fifty thousand kilometers away nearly twice as far away as Rotor had been from Earth it was Marlenes excitement that reinvigorated her
	The ship that would take them to Erythro was neither graceful nor beautiful It was serviceable It was one of a small fleet of rockets that acted as ferries blasting up from the stodgy gravitational pull of Erythro or coming down without daring to give in to it by even a trifle and either way working ones way through the cushiony windy unpredictability of an untamed atmosphere
	Insigna didnt think the trip would be pleasurable Through most of it they would be weightless and two solid days of weightlessness would no doubt be tedious
	Marlenes voice broke into her reverie Come on Mother theyre waiting for us The baggage is all checked and everything
	Insigna moved forward Her last uneasy thought as she passed through the airlock waspredictablyBut why was Janus Pitt so willing to let us go
	Siever Genarr ruled a world as large as Earth Or to be more accurate perhaps he ruled directly a domed region that covered nearly three square kilometers and was slowly growing The rest of the world however nearly five hundred million square kilometers of land and sea was unoccupied by human beings It was also occupied by no other living things above the microscopic scale So if a world is considered as being ruled by the multicellular lifeforms that occupied it the hundreds who lived and worked in the domed region were the rulers and Siever Genarr ruled over them
	Genarr was not a large man but his strong features gave him an impressive look When he was young this had made him look older than his agebut that had evened itself out now that he was nearly fifty His nose was long and his eyes somewhat pouchy His hair was in the first stages of grizzle His voice however was a musical and resonant baritone He had once thought of the stage as a career but his appearance doomed him to occasional character roles and his talents as an administrator took precedence
	It was those talentspartlythat had kept him in the Erythro Dome for ten years watching it grow from an uncertain threeroom structure to the expansive mining and research station it had now become
	The Dome had its disadvantages Few people remained long There were shifts since almost all those who came there considered themselves in exile and wished more or less constantly to return to Rotor And most found the pinkish light of Nemesis either threatening or gloomy even though the light inside the Dome was every bit as bright and homelike as that on Rotor
	It had its advantages too Genarr was removed from the hurlyburly of Rotorian politics which seemed more ingrown and meaningless each year Even more important he was removed from Janus Pitt whose views he generallyand uselesslyopposed
	Pitt had been strenuously opposed to any settlement on Erythro from the starteven to Rotor orbiting around Erythro Here at least Pitt had been defeated by overwhelming public opinion but he saw to it that the Dome was generally starved for funds and that its growth was slowed If Genarr had not successfully developed the Dome as a source of water for Rotorfar cheaper than it could be obtained from the asteroidsPitt might have crushed it
	In general though Pitts principle of ignoring the Domes existence as far as possible meant that he rarely attempted to interfere with Genarrs administrative procedureswhich suited Genarr right down to Erythros damp soil
	It came as a surprise to him then that Pitt should have bothered to inform him personally of the arrival of a pair of newcomers instead of allowing the information to show up in the routine paperwork Pitt had indeed discussed the matter in detail in his usual clipped and arbitrary manner that invited no discussion or even comment and the conversation had been shielded too
	It came as an even greater surprise that one of the people coming to Erythro was Eugenia Insigna
	Once years before the Leaving they had been friends but then after their happy college days Genarr remembered them wistfully as rather romantic Eugenia had gone to Earth for her graduate studies and had returned to Rotor with an Earthman Genarr had scarcely seen herexcept once or twice at a distancesince she had married Crile Fisher And when she and Fisher had separated just before the Leaving Genarr had had work of his own and so had sheand it never occurred to either to renew old ties
	Genarr had perhaps thought of it occasionally but Eugenia was quite apparently sunk in sorrow with an infant daughter to raise and he was reluctant to intrude Then he was sent to Erythro and that ended even the possibility of renewal He had periodic vacation time on Rotor but he was never at ease there any longer Some old Rotorian friendships remained but only in lukewarm fashion
	Now Eugenia was coming with her daughter Genarr at the moment didnt remember the girls nameif he had ever known it Certainly he had never seen her The daughter should be fifteen by now and he wondered with a queer little interior tremble if she was beginning to look anything like the young Eugenia had
	Genarr looked out his office window with an almost surreptitious air He had grown so used to Erythro Dome that he no longer saw it with a critical eye It was the home of working people of both sexesadults no children Shift workers signed up for a period of weeks or possibly months sometimes returning eventually for another shift sometimes not Except for himself and four others who for one reason or another had learned to prefer the Dome there were no permanents
	There was no one to take pride in it as an ordinary abode It was kept clean and orderly as a matter of necessity but there was also an air of artificiality about it It was too much a matter of lines and arcs planes and circles It lacked irregularity lacked the chaos of permanent life where a room or even just a desk had adjusted itself to the hollows and waverings of a particular personality
	There was himself of course His desk and his room reflected his own angular and planar person That perhaps might be another reason he was at home in the Erythro Dome The shape of his inner spirit matched its spare geometry
	But what would Eugenia Insigna think of it He was rather pleased she had resumed her maiden name If she were as he remembered her she would revel in irregularity in the unexpected touch of frippery for all she was an astronomer
	Or had she changed Did people ever change essentially Had Crile Fishers desertion embittered her twisted her
	Genarr scratched the hair at his temple where it had gone distinctly gray and thought that these speculations were useless and timewasting He would see Eugenia soon enough for he had left word that she was to be brought to him as soon as she had arrived
	Or should he have gone to greet her in person No He had argued that with himself half a dozen times already He couldnt look too anxious it wouldnt suit the dignity of his position
	But then Genarr thought that that wasnt the reason at all He didnt want to make her uneasy he didnt want her to think he was still the same uncomfortable and incompetent admirer who had retreated in so shambling a manner before the tall and brooding good looks of the Earthman And Eugenia had never looked at him again after she had seen Crilenever seriously looked at him
	Genarrs eyes scanned the message from Janus Pittdry condensed as his messages always were and with that indefinable feel of authority behind it as though the possibility of disagreement were not merely unheard ofbut actually unthought of
	And he now noted that Pitt spoke more forcefully of the young daughter than of the mother There was especially Pitts statement that the daughter had expressed a deep interest in Erythro and if she wished to explore its surface she was to be allowed to
	Now why was that
	And there she was Fourteen years older than at the time of the Leaving Twenty years older than she was in her preCrile youth the day they had gone into Farming Area C and climbed the levels into low gravity and she had laughed when he tried a low somersault and had turned too far and had come down on his belly Actually he could easily have hurt himself for though the sensation of weight decreased mass and inertia did not and damage could follow Fortunately he had not suffered that humiliation
	Eugenia looked older too but she had not thickened very much and her hairshorter now and straightwas more matteroffact somehow but was still a lively dark brown
	And when she advanced toward him smiling he could feel his traitor heart speed a bit She held out both hands and he took them
	Siever she said I have betrayed you and Im so ashamed
	Betrayed me Eugenia What are you talking about What was she talking about Surely not her marriage to Crile
	She said I should have thought of you every day I should have sent you messages given you the news insisted on coming to visit you
	Instead you never thought of me at all
	Oh Im not that bad I thought of you every once in a while I never really forgot you Dont think that for a moment Its just that my thoughts never really prompted me to do anything
	Genarr nodded What was there to say He said I know youve been busy And Ive been hereout of sight and therefore out of mind
	Not out of mind Youve scarcely changed at all Siever
	Thats the advantage of looking old and craggy when youre twenty After that you never change Eugenia Time passes and you just look a trifle older and a trifle craggier Not enough to matter
	Come now you make a profession of being cruel to yourself so that softhearted women will leap to your defense That hasnt changed at all
	Wheres your daughter Eugenia I was told she would be coming with you
	She came You can be sure of that Erythro is her idea of Paradise for no reason I can possibly think of She went to our quarters to straighten them out and unpack for the two of us Shes that kind of young woman Serious Responsible Practical Dutiful She possesses what someone once described to me as all the unlovable virtues
	Genarr laughed Im quite at home with them If you only knew how hard Ive tried in my time to cultivate at least one charming vice Ive always failed
	Oh well as one grows older I suspect one needs more unlovable virtues and fewer charming vices But why did you retreat permanently to Erythro Siever I understand that Erythro Dome has to be administered but surely youre not the only one on Rotor who can do the job
	Genarr said  Actually I like to think I am In a way though I enjoy it here and I do get to Rotor on occasion for a short vacation
	And never come to see me
	Just because I have a vacation doesnt mean you do I suspect youre far busier than I am and have been ever since you discovered Nemesis But Im disappointed I wanted to meet your daughter
	You will Her names Marlene Actually its Molly in my heart but she wont allow that At the age of fifteen she has become remarkably intolerant and insists on being called Marlene But youll meet her never fear Actually I didnt want her here the first time How could we reminisce freely with her present
	Do you want to reminisce Eugenia
	About some things
	Genarr hesitated Im sorry Crile didnt join the Leaving Insignas smile became fixed  About some things Siever She turned away and walked to the window staring out This is an elaborate place you have here by the way Just the little Ive seen of it is impressive Bright lights Actual streets Sizable buildings And yet the Dome is hardly ever spoken of or referred to back on Rotor How many people live and work here
	It varies We have our slow and busy times Weve had as many as nearly nine hundred people here At the moment the number is five hundred and sixteen We know every individual present Its not easy Each day sees some come some go
	Except you
	And a few others
	But why the Dome Siever After all Erythros atmosphere is breathable
	Genarr pushed out his lower lip and for the first time he did not meet her eyes Breathable but not really comfortable The light level is wrong When you get outside the Dome youre bathed in a pinkish light tending to orange when Nemesis is high in the sky Its bright enough You can read Still it doesnt seem natural Then too Nemesis itself doesnt look natural It looks too large and most people think it looks threatening and that its reddish light makes it seem angryand they get depressed Nemesis is dangerous in actual fact too at least in a way Because it isnt blindingly bright there is a tendency to gaze at it and watch for sunspots The infrared can easily harm the retina People who must go out in the open wear a special helmet for that reasonamong other things
	Then the Dome is more of a device to keep normal light in so to speak rather than to keep anything out
	We dont even keep air out The air and water that circulates in the Dome is drawn from Erythros planetary supply Naturally though were careful to keep something out said Genarr We keep out the prokaryotes You know the little bluegreen cells
	Insigna nodded thoughtfully That had turned out to be the explanation for the oxygen content in the air There was life on Erythro even allpervasive life but it was microscopic in nature only equivalent to the simplest forms of cellular life in the Solar System
	She said  Are they really prokaryotes I know thats what theyre called but thats what our bacteria are also called Are they bacteria
	If theyre equivalent to anything in the history of Solar System life it is to the cyanobacteria those that photosynthesize Youre right to ask the question though No theyre not our cyanobacteria They possess nucleoprotein but with a structure fundamentally different from that which prevails in our form of life They also have a kind of chlorophyll that lacks magnesium and works on infrared so that the cells tend to be colorless rather than green Different enzymes trace minerals in different proportions Still they resemble Earth cells sufficiently in outer appearance to be called prokaryotes I understand that biologists are pushing for the word erythryotes but for nonbiologists like ourselves prokaryotes is good enough
	And theyre efficient enough in their workings to account for the oxygen in Erythros atmosphere
	Absolutely Nothing else could possibly explain its existence there By the way Eugenia youre the astronomer so whats the latest thinking on how old Nemesis might be
	Insigna shrugged Red dwarfs are next to being immortal Nemesis can be as old as the Universe and still go on for another hundred billion years or so without visible change The best we can do is judge by the contents of the minor elements making up its structure Supposing that its a firstgeneration star and didnt begin with anything beyond hydrogen and helium it is a bit over ten billion years olda little more than twice the age of the Sun of the Solar System
	Then Erythro is ten billion years old too
	Absolutely A stellar system is formed all at once and not piecemeal Why are you asking
	It just strikes me as odd that in ten billion years life hasnt got past the prokaryote stage
	I dont think thats surprising Siever On Earth for somewhere between two and three billion years after life first appeared it remained strictly prokaryote and here on Erythro the energy concentration in sunlight is far less than it is on Earth It takes energy to form more complicated lifeforms This sort of thing has been pretty well discussed among the Rotorians
	Im sure of it said Genarr but it doesnt seem to reach us here at the Dome Our minds are too fixed I suppose on our local duties and problemsthough youd think anything to do with the prokaryotes would come under that heading
	For that matter said Insigna we dont hear much about the Dome on Rotor
	Yes things tend to compartmentalize But then of course theres nothing glamorous about the Dome Eugenia Its just a workshop so Im not surprised it gets lost in the press of events on Rotor Its the new Settlements that are being built that get all the attention Are you going to move to one of them
	Never Im a Rotorian and I intend to stay one I wouldnt even be hereif youll pardon my saying soif it werent an astronomical necessity Ive got to make a number of observations from a base that is more stable than Rotor
	So I have been informed by Pitt I am instructed to give you my full cooperation
	Good Im sure you will Incidentally you mentioned earlier that the Dome would like to keep the prokaryotes out Do you succeed in doing so Is the water here safe to drink
	Genarr said Obviously since we drink it There are no prokaryotes in the Dome Any water that comes inanything at all that comes inis bathed in blueviolet light that destroys the prokaryotes in a matter of seconds The shortwave photons in the light are too energetic for the little things and break down key components of the cells And even if some of them come in theyre not poisonous as far as we can tell or harmful in any way Weve tested them on animals
	Thats a relief
	It works the other way too Our own microorganisms cant compete with Erythros prokaryotes under Erythrotic conditions At least when we seed Erythros soil with our own bacteria they dont succeed in growing and multiplying
	What about multicellular plants
	Weve tried it but with very poor results And it must be due to the quality of Nemesis light because we can grow plants perfectly well inside the Dome using Erythros soil and water We report these things back to Rotor of course but I doubt that the information gets widely publicized As I said Rotor isnt interested in the Dome Certainly the fearsome Pitt isnt interested in us and hes really all that counts on Rotor isnt he
	Genarr said that with a smile but the smile seemed strained What would Marlene have said about it Insigna wondered
	She said Pitt isnt fearsome Hes sometimes tiresome but thats a different thing You know Siever I always thought when we were young that you might be Commissioner someday You were enormously bright you know
	Were
	Still are Im sure but in those days you were so politically oriented had such ideas I used to listen to you entranced In some ways you would have been a better Commissioner than Janus is You would have listened to people You wouldnt have insisted on getting your own way as much
	Which is precisely why I would have made a very poor Commissioner You see I dont have any precise goals in life I just have the desire to do what seems to me to be the right thing at the moment in the hope that it will end up with something bearable Now Pitt knows what he wants and intends to get there by any means
	Youre misjudging him Siever Hes got strong views but hes a very reasonable man
	Of course Eugenia Thats his great gift his reasonableness Whatever course he pursues he always has a perfectly good a perfectly logical a perfectly human reason for it He can make one up at any given moment and is so sincere about it he convinces even himself Im sure if youve had any dealings with him youve managed to let him talk you into doing what you at first didnt want to do and that he won you over not by orders and threats but by very patient very rational arguments 
	Insigna said weakly Well At that Genarr added sardonically I see you have indeed suffered from his reasonableness You can see for yourself then what a good Commissioner he is Not a good person but a good Commissioner
	I wouldnt go so far as to say he wasnt a good person Siever said Insigna shaking her head slightly
	Well lets not argue about it I want to meet your daughter He rose to his feet Why dont I visit your quarters after dinner
	That would be delightful said Insigna
	Genarr looked after her with a fading smile as she left Eugenia had wanted to reminisce and his own first reaction was to mention her husbandand she had frozen
	He sighed inwardly He still had that extraordinary faculty of ruining his own chances
	Eugenia Insigna said to her daughter His name is Siever Genarr and he is properly addressed as Commander because hes the head of the Erythro Dome
	Of course Mother If thats his title Ill call him that
	And I dont want you to embarrass him
	I wouldnt do that
	You would do so all too easily Marlene You know that Just accept his statements without correcting them on the ground of body language Please He was a good friend of mine at college and for a while afterward And even though hes been here in the Dome for ten years and I havent seen him in all that time hes still an old friend
	I think he must have been a boyfriend
	Now thats just what I mean said Insigna I dont want you watching him and telling him what he really means or thinks or feels And for your information he was not my boyfriend exactly and we were certainly not lovers We were friends and we liked each otheras friends But after your father She shook her head and gestured vaguely  And be careful what you say about Commissioner Pittif that subject comes up I get the feeling Commander Genarr distrusts Commissioner Pitt
	Marlene bestowed one of her rare smiles on her mother Have you been studying Commander Sievers subliminal behavior Because what you have is more than a feeling
	Insigna shook her head You see You cant stop for a moment Very well its not a feeling He actually said he didnt trust the Commissioner And you know she added half to herself he may have reason
	She turned to Marlene and said suddenly Let me repeat Marlene You are perfectly free to watch the Commander and find out all you can but dont say anything to him about it Tell me Do you understand
	Do you think theres danger Mother
	I dont know
	I do said Marlene matteroffactly Ive known there was danger as soon as Commissioner Pitt said we could go to Erythro I just dont know what the danger is
	Seeing Marlene for the first time was a shock to Siever Genarr one that was made worse by the fact that the girl looked at him with a sullen expression that made it seem that she knew perfectly well that he had received a shock and just why
	The fact was that there was not a thing about her that seemed to indicate she was Eugenias daughter none of the beauty none of the grace none of the charm Only those large bright eyes that were now boring into him and they werent Eugenias either They were the one respect in which she exceeded her mother rather than fell short
	Little by little though he revised his first impression He joined them for tea and dessert and Marlene behaved herself with perfect propriety Quite the lady and obviously intelligent What was it that Eugenia had said All the unlovable virtues Not quite that bad It seemed to him that she ached for love as plain people sometimes do As he himself did A sudden flood of fellow feeling swept over him
	And after a while he said Eugenia I wonder if I might have a chance to speak to Marlene alone
	Insigna said with an attempt at lightness  Any particular reason Siever
	Genarr said Well it was Marlene who spoke to Commissioner Pitt and it was she who persuaded the Commissioner to allow the two of you to come to the Dome As Commander of the Dome Im pretty much dependent on what Commissioner Pitt says and does and I would value what Marlene can tell me of the meeting I think she would speak more freely if it were just the two of us
	Genarr watched Insigna leave and then turned to Marlene who was now sitting in a large chair in a corner of the room almost lost in its soft capaciousness Her hands were clasped loosely in her lap and her beautiful dark eyes regarded the Commander gravely
	Genarr said with a hint of humor in his voice Your mother seemed a little nervous about leaving you here with me Are you nervous too
	Not at all said Marlene  And if my mother was nervous it was on your behalf not on mine
	On my behalf Why
	She thinks I might say something that would offend you
	Would you Marlene
	Not deliberately Commander Ill try not to
	And Im sure youll succeed Do you know why I want to see you alone
	You told my mother you want to find out about my interview with Commissioner Pitt Thats true but you also want to see what Im like
	Genarrs eyebrows drew together just a trifle Naturally I would want to get to know you better
	Its not that said Marlene quickly What is it then
	Marlene looked away Im sorry Commander
	Sorry about what
	Marlenes face twitched unhappily and she was silent
	Genarr said softly Now Marlene what is wrong You must tell me It is important to me that we talk frankly If your mother told you to watch what you say please forget that If she implied that I was sensitive and easily offended please forget that too In fact I command you to speak to me freely and not to worry a bit about offending me and you must obey my command because Im the Commander of the Erythro Dome
	Marlene laughed suddenly Youre really anxious to find out about me arent you
	Of course
	Because youre wondering how I can look the way I do when Im my mothers daughter
	Genarrs eyes opened wide I never said anything of the sort
	You didnt have to Youre an old friend of my mothers She told me that much But you were in love with her and you havent quite gotten over it and you were expecting me to look the way she did when she was young so when you saw me you winced and drew back
	I did It was noticeable
	It was a very small gesture because youre a polite man and you tried to repress it but it was there I saw it easily And then your eyes turned to my mother and back to me And then there was the tone of your first words to me It was all very plain You were thinking I didnt look at all like my mother and you were disappointed
	Genarr leaned back in his chair and said But this is marvelous And a great gladness lit up Marlenes face You mean it commander You mean it Youre not offended Youre not uncomfortable It makes you happy Youre the first one the first one Even my mother doesnt like it
	Liking or not liking it doesnt matter That is totally irrelevant when its a question of coming up against the extraordinary How long have you been able to read body language in this way Marlene
	Always but Ive gotten better at it I think anyone must be able to do it if they only watchand think
	Not so Marlene It cant be done Dont think it And you say I love your mother
	No doubt about it Commander When youre near her you give it away with every look every word every twitch
	Do you suppose she notices
	She suspects you do but she doesnt want you to Genarr looked away She never did
	Its my father
	I know
	Marlene hesitated But I think shes wrong If she could see you the way I do right now
	But she cant unfortunately It makes me so happy that you do though Youre beautiful
	Marlene flushed Then she said You mean that
	Of course I do
	But
	I cant lie to you can I So I wont try Your face isnt beautiful Your body isnt beautiful But you are beautiful and thats whats important And you can tell I really believe that
	Yes I do said Marlene smiling with such genuine happiness that even her face had a sudden distant cast of beauty
	Genarr smiled too and said Shall we now talk about Commissioner Pitt Now that I know what an uncommonly shrewd young woman you are it is all the more important I do so Are you willing
	Marlene clasped her hands lightly in her lap smiled demurely and said Yes Uncle Siever You dont mind if I call you that do you
	Not at all In fact Im honored Nowtell me all about Commissioner Pitt He has sent me instructions that Im to give your mother all possible cooperation and that I am to make freely available to her all our astronomical equipment Why do you suppose that is
	My mother wants to make delicate measurements of Nemesis motion relative to the stars and Rotor is too unsteady a base for those measurements Erythro will do much better
	Is this project of hers a recent one
	No Uncle Siever Shes been trying to get the necessary data for a long time she told me
	Then why didnt your mother ask to come here a long time ago
	She did but Commissioner Pitt refused
	Why did he agree now
	Because he wanted to get rid of her
	Im sure of thatif she kept bothering him with her astronomical problems But he must have been tired of her a long time ago Why does he send her now 
	Marlenes voice was low He wanted to get rid of me 


Fourteen Fishing


	Five years had now passed since the Leaving Crile Fisher found that hard to believe since it seemed so much longer than that infinitely longer Rotor was not in the past but in another life altogether one that he could only view with gathering incredulity Had he really lived there Had he had a wife
	He remembered only his daughter clearly and even that had its element of confusion for sometimes it seemed to him he remembered her as a teenager
	Of course the problem was compounded by the fact that his life in the last three years ever since Earth had discovered the Neighbor Star had been a hectic one He had visited seven different settlements All of these were inhabited by Settlers of his own skin shade who spoke more or less his language and shared more or less his cultural orientation That was the advantage of Earths variety Earth could supply an agent similar in appearance and culture to the general population of any Settlement
	Of course there was a limit to how closely he could melt into any Settlement No matter how he matched its population superficially he still had a distinctive accent of speech he could not remain as graceful as they under changes of gravitational pull he could not skim along as they did in low gravity In a dozen ways he betrayed himself on each Settlement he visited and always they withdrew from him just slightly even though in each case he had gone through quarantine and medical treatment before being allowed to even enter the Settlement proper
	Of course he remained on each Settlement only a few days to a few weeks Never was he expected to remain on a Settlement on a semipermanent basis or to build himself a family there as he had done on Rotor But then Rotor had had hyperassistance and since then Earth had been looking for items of narrower importance or at least he had been sent on tasks of narrower importance
	He had been back now for three months There was no word of a new assignment and he was not anxious for one He was tired of the uprooting tired of not fitting in tired of the pretense of being a tourist
	And there was Garand Wyler his old friend and colleague fresh from a Settlement of his own and staring at him with tired eyes The dark skin of his graceful hand glimmered in the light as he raised his sleeve to his nose for a moment then let it drop
	Fisher halfsmiled He knew the gesture had gone through it himself Each Settlement had its own characteristic odor depending on the crops it grew the spices it used the perfumes it affected the very nature of the machinery and lubricants it used It quickly went unnoticed but on the return to Earth the Settlement odor clung to one quite detectably And though the person might be bathed and the clothing washed so that others did not notice one still noticed the smell on himself
	Fisher said Welcome back How was your Settlement this time
	As alwaysterrible Old Man Tanayama is correct What all the
	Settlements fear and hate most is variety They dont want differences in appearance tastes ways and life They select themselves for uniformity and despise everything else
	Fisher said Youre right And its too bad Wyler said Thats a mild unfeeling way of putting it Too bad
	Oops I dropped the dish Oh too bad Whoops my contact seal is out of line Oh too bad Were talking humanity here Were talking about Earths long struggle to find a way of living together all cultures all appearances It isnt perfect yet but compare it to how it was even a century ago and its heaven Then when we get a chance to move into space we shuck it all off and move right back into the Dark Ages And you say Too bad Thats some reaction to something thats an enormous tragedy
	I agree said Fisher but unless you can tell me something practical I can do about it what does it matter how eloquently I denounce it You were at Akruma werent you
	Yes said Wyler
	Did they know about the Neighbor Star
	Certainly As far as I know the news has now reached every Settlement
	Were they concerned
	Not a bit Why should they be Theyve got thousands of years Long before the Neighbor Star is anywhere near and if it should seem to be dangerous which isnt absolutely certain you know they can wander off They can all wander off They admire Rotor and only wait for a chance to get away themselves Wyler was frowning his tone bitter
	He went on Theyll all leave and well be stuck How are we going to build enough Settlements for eight billion human beings and get them all away
	You sound just like Tanayama What good will it do us to chase them down and punish them or destroy them Well still be here and well still be stuck If they all stayed behind like good kids and faced the Neighbor Star with us would we be better off
	Youre cold about this Crile Tanayama is hot and Im on his side Hes hot enough to pull the Galaxy apart if necessary to find hyperassistance on our own He wants it so we can chase after Rotor and blow them out of space but even if that does no good were going to need hyperassistance to get as many people off Earth as possible if it turns out that the Neighbor Star will make it necessary So what Tanayama is doing is right even if his motives are wrong
	And suppose we have hyperassistance and then we find we only have the time and the resources to get a billion people off Which is the billion that goes And what happens if those who are in charge start saving only their own kind
	Wyler growled It doesnt bear thinking of
	It doesnt agreed Fisher Lets be glad well be long gone before even the barest beginning can be made
	If it comes to that said Wyler his voice suddenly dropping The barest beginning may already have been made I suspect we have hyperassistance now or just about have it
	Fishers expression was one of deep cynicism What makes you think that Dreams Intuition
	No I know a woman whose sister knows someone on the Old Mans staff Will that do you
	Of course not Youll have to give me more than that
	Im not in a position to Look Crile Im your friend You know I helped you get back your status in the Office
	Crile nodded I do and I appreciate it And Ive tried to make an adequate return now and then
	You have done so and I appreciate that Now what I want to do is give you some information which is supposed to be confidential and which I think you will find useful and important Are you ready to accept it and keep me clear
	Always ready
	You know what weve been doing of course
	Fisher said Yes It was the kind of useless rhetorical question that required no other answer
	For five years agents of the Office for the last three years Fisher among them had been rummaging in the informational garbage heaps of the Settlements Scavenging
	Every Settlement was working on hyperassistance just as Earth itself was ever since the word had leaked out that Rotor had it and certainly ever since Rotor had proved the fact by leaving the Solar System
	Presumably most Settlements perhaps all had obtained some scrap of what it was that Rotor had done By the Open Science Agreement each one of those scraps should have been laid on the table and if all were then put together it might have meant practical hyperassistance for all That however was clearly too much to ask in this particular case There was no telling what useful side effects might be born of the new technique and no Settlement could abandon the hope that it might be first in the field and in this way gain an important lead on the others in one way or another So each hoarded what it had if it had anythingand not one of them had enough
	And Earth itself with its vastly elaborate Terrestrial Board of Inquiry sniffed at all the Settlements indiscriminately Earth was fishing and Fisher appropriately enough was one of the fishermen
	Wyler said slowly Weve put what weve got together and I gather its enough Well be able to have hyperassisted travel And Im thinking well go out to the Neighbor Star Wouldnt you want to be on that trip when it goes out there
	Why do I want to be on it Garand If theres going to be such a trip which I doubt
	Im pretty sure there will be I cant give you my source but take my word for it its reliable And of course youll want to make the trip You might see your wife Or if not heryour kid
	Fisher moved restlessly It seemed to him he spent half his days now trying not to think of those eyes Marlene would be six years old now talking in a quiet deliberate waylike Roseanne Seeing through peoplelike Roseanne
	He said Youre talking nonsense Garand Even if there were such a flight why would they let me be on it They would send specialists of one sort or another Besides if theres one person the Old Man will keep off its me He may have let me get back into the Office and given me assignments but you know how he is about failures and I certainly failed him on Rotor
	Yes but thats the very point Thats what makes you a specialist If hes going after Rotor how can he fail to include the one Earthman who lived on Rotor for four years Who would understand Rotor better and who would know better how to deal with them Ask to see him Point this out but remember youre not supposed to know that we have hyperassistance Just talk possibilities make use of the subjunctive And dont drag me into it in any way Im not supposed to know about it either
	Fishers brow furrowed in thought Was it possible He dared not hope
	The next day while Fisher was still wondering whether to risk asking for an interview with Tanayama the decision was taken out of his hands He was summoned
	A simple agent is rarely summoned by the Director There are plenty of deputies to grind away at them And if an agent is summoned by the Old Man it is almost never good news So Crile Fisher prepared himself with grim resignation for an assignment as an inspector of the fertilizer factories
	Tanayama looked up at him from behind his desk Fisher had seen him only rarely and briefly in the three years since Earths discovery of the Neighbor Star and he seemed unchanged He had been small and shriveled for so long that there seemed no room for any further physical change The sharpness of his eyes had not abated either nor the withered grim set of his lips He might even be wearing the same garments he had worn three years before Fisher could not tell
	But if the harsh voice too was the same the tone was surprising Apparently in the face of astronomical odds the Old Man had called him in for the purpose of praising him
	Tanayama said in his queer and not altogether unpleasant distortion of Planetary English Fisher you have done well I want you to hear that from me
	Fisher standing he had not been invited to sit down managed to suppress his small start of surprise
	The Director said There can be no public celebration of this no laserbeam parade no holographic procession It is not in the nature of things But I tell you this
	That is quite enough Director said Fisher I thank you
	Tanayama stared fixedly at Fisher out of his narrow eyes Finally he said  And is that all you have to say No questions
	I presume Director you will tell me what I need to know
	You are an agent a capable man What have you found out for yourself
	Nothing Director I do not seek to find out anything but what I am instructed to find out
	Tanayamas small head nodded very slightly An appropriate answer but I seek inappropriate ones What have you guessed
	You seem pleased with me Director and it may therefore be that I have brought in some information that has proved useful to you
	In what respect
	I think nothing would prove more useful to you than having obtained the technique of hyperassistance
	Tanayamas mouth made a noiseless Ahhh He said And next Assuming this to be so what are we to do next
	Travel to the Neighbor Star Locate Rotor
	Nothing better than that That is all there is to do You see no farther
	And at this point Fisher decided it would be foolish not to gamble He could not possibly be handed a better opportunity One thing better that when the first Earth vessel goes out of the Solar System by means of hyperassistance I be on it
	Fisher had scarcely said that when he knew his gamble was lostor at least not won Tanayamas face darkened He said in a sharply imperative tone Sit down
	Fisher could hear the soft movement of the chair behind him rolling toward him at the words of Tanayama words that its primitive computerized motor could understand
	Fisher sat down without looking behind him to make certain the chair was there To have done so would have been insulting and at the present moment there was no room to insult Tanayama
	Tanayama said Why do you want to be on the vessel
	With an effort Fisher kept his voice level Director I have a wife on Rotor
	A wife you abandoned five years ago Do you think she would welcome you back
	Director I have a child
	She was one year old when you left Do you think she knows she has a father Or cares
	Fisher was silent These were points that he had thought about himself over and over
	Tanayama waited briefly then said But there will be no flight to the Neighbor Star There will be no vessel for you to be on
	Again Fisher had to suppress surprise He said Forgive me Director You did not say we had hyperassistance You said Assuming this to be So I should have noted your choice of words
	So you should have done So you should always do Nevertheless we do have hyperassistance We can now move through space just as Rotor has done or at least we will once we build a vehicle and are sure the design is adequate and all its features workablewhich may take a year or two But then what Are you seriously suggesting we take it to the Neighbor Star
	Fisher said cautiously Surely that is an option Director
	A useless one Think it out man The Neighbor Star is over two lightyears away No matter how skillfully we make use of hyperassistance it will take us more than two years to arrive there Our theoreticians now tell me that while hyperassistance will allow a ship to go faster than light for brief periods of timethe faster the brieferthe end result is always that it cannot reach any point in space faster than a ray of light would have if the two had started from the same point of origin
	But if that is So
	If that is so you would be forced to remain on a spaceship in close quarters with several other crewpeople for over two years Do you think you can endure that You know very well that small ships have never made long trips What we need is a Settlement a structure large enough to provide a reasonable environmentlike Rotor How long will that take
	I couldnt say Director
	Perhaps ten years if all works wellif there are no hitches or mishaps Remember we havent built a Settlement in nearly a century All the recent Settlements have been built by other Settlements If suddenly we begin building one we will attract the attention of all the Settlements that already exist and that must be avoided Then too if such a Settlement can be built and outfitted with hyperassistance and sent to the Neighbor Star in over a twoyear flight what will it do when it gets there As a Settlement it will be vulnerable and easy to destroy if Rotor has warships as it certainly will have Rotor will have more warships than we could possibly carryon our traveling Settlement After all they have been there for three years already and may be there for twelve more years before we get there They will blow our Settlement out of space on sight
	In that case Director
	No further guessing Agent Fisher In that case we must have true hyperspatial travel so that we may move any distance we like in as short a period as we like
	Pardon me Director but is that possible Even in theory
	That is not for you or me to say We need scientists to concentrate on the matter and we dont have them For a century or more Earth has suffered a brain drain to the Settlements So now we must reverse that We must raid the Settlements after a fashion and persuade the best physicists and engineers to come to Earth We can offer them a great deal but it will have to be done carefully We cant be too open you understand or the Settlements will certainly forestall us Now
	He paused and studied Fisher thoughtfully
	Fisher stirred uneasily and said Yes Director
	The physicist I have my eye on is one T A Wendel who Im told is the best hyperspatialist in the Solar System
	It was the hyperspatialists on Rotor who discovered hyperassistance Fisher could not resist allowing a certain dryness to enter his voice
	Tanayama ignored that He said Discoveries can be made by happy accident and an inferior mind can stumble ahead while a superior one is taking the time to lay a firm foundation That has frequently happened in history Besides Rotor only has what proved in the end to be merely hyperassistance a speedoflight drive I want a superluminal drive one that is far beyond the speed of light And I want Wendel
	And do you wish me to get him for you
	Her Shes a woman Tessa Anita Wendel of Adelia
	Oh
	That is why we want you for the job Apparentlyand here Tanayama seemed to radiate a quiet amusement although nothing in his facial expression seemed to indicate thatyou are irresistible to women
	Fishers expression grew wooden I ask pardon for contradicting you Director but I do not find it so I have never found it so
	The reports are persuasive just the same Wendel is a middleaged woman in her forties twicedivorced She should not be hard to persuade 
	To be honest sir I find the assignment distasteful and under those circumstances it is possible another agent would be better suited for the task
	But I want you just the same If you fear that you would not be your flirtatious and maddeningly attractive self if you approached her with face averted and nose wrinkled I will sweeten matters for you Agent Fisher You failed on Rotor but your service since has in part made up for it You can now completely make up for it If however you do not bring back this woman that will be a far greater failure than Rotor was and you will never have the chance to make up for that Still I dont want you governed by apprehension alone I will throw in a bit of anticipation Bring back Wendel and when a superluminal vessel is built and heads out toward the Neighbor Star you will be on it if you wish
	I will do my best said Fisher and I would have done my best even if there were no occasion for either apprehension or anticipation
	An excellent answer said Tanayama allowing himself the thinnest of smiles and undoubtedly well rehearsed
	And Fisher left fully realizing that he had been sent out on his most crucial fishing expedition yet


Fifteen Plague


	Eugenia Insigna smiled at Genarr over dessert You seem to lead a pleasant life here
	Genarr smiled too Pleasant enough but claustrophobic We live on a huge world but Im bounded by the Dome The people here tend to be ingrown When I do meet someone interesting they leave in a couple of months at most Generally the people here in the Dome bore me most of the time though probably not as much as I bore them Thats why the arrival of you and your daughter would have been a holovision item even if you were anyone else Of course since its you
	Flatterer said Insigna sadly
	Genarr cleared his throat Marlene warned me for my own good you understand that you have not quite gotten over
	But Insigna overrode him suddenly I cant say Ive noticed any holovision attention
	Genarr gave up He said Just a manner of speaking Were planning a little party tomorrow evening and youll then be formally introduced and everyone will get a chance to know you
	And discuss my appearance and choice of costume and chew over whatever is known about me
	Im sure of it But Marlene will be invited too and that means I suppose that you will know a great deal more about all of us than we will about you Your information will be more reliable too
	Insigna looked uneasy Did Marlene act up
	You mean did she read my body language Yes maam
	I told her not to
	I dont think she can help it
	Youre right She cant But I told her not to tell you about it I take it she did tell you
	Oh yes I ordered her to do so Actually I commanded her to do so in my role as Commander
	Well Im sorry It can be so annoying
	But it wasnt Not to me Eugenia please understand this I like your daughter I like her very much I have the idea that she has had a miserable life being someone who knows too much and whom no one likes That she has turned out full of what you referred to as the unlovable virtues is little short of a miracle
	I warn you Shell tire you out And shes only fifteen
	Genarr said Theres some law I think that prevents mothers from ever remembering when they themselves were fifteen She casually mentioned a boy and you may know that the pangs of unrequited love hurt as deeply at fifteen as at twentyfive maybe even more so Though your teenage years may well have been sunny ones considering your appearance Remember too that Marlene is in a particularly bad position She knows shes plain and she knows shes intelligent She feels that intelligence should much more than make up for lack of beauty and she also knows that it doesnt so she rages helplessly and knows that that does no good either
	Well Siever said Insigna trying to sound light youre quite the psychologist 
	No not at all Its just this one thing I understand Ive been through it myself
	Oh Insigna seemed at a loss
	Its all right Eugenia I have no intention of being sorry for myself and I wasnt trying to lure you into sympathy for a poor broken soulbecause Im not Im fortynine not fifteen and Ive made my peace with myself Had I been handsome and stupid when I was fifteen or twentyone as at that time in life I wished I had been I would undoubtedly now no longer be handsomebut Id still be stupid So in the long run Ive won out and so Im positive will Marleneif there is a long run
	And what do you mean by that Siever
	Marlene tells me that she talked to our good friend Pitt and that she deliberately antagonized him in order to make him willing to send you to Erythro because that meant getting rid of her too
	I dont approve of that said Eugenia I dont mean about manipulating Pitt because I dont think Pitt is that easy to manipulate I mean trying to do it Marlene is getting to the point where she thinks she can pull puppet strings and this may get her into serious trouble
	Eugenia I do not wish to frighten you but I think Marlene is in serious trouble right now At least it may be Pitts hope that she will be
	Now Siever thats impossible Pitt may be opinionated and overbearing but theres nothing vicious about him Hes not going to strike out at a teenage girl just because she played foolish games with him
	The dinner was over but the lights were still somewhat lowered in Genarrs rather elegant quarters and Insigna reacted with a slight frown as Genarr leaned over to close the contact that activated the shield
	Secrets Siever she said with a forced laugh
	Yes as a matter of fact Eugenia Im going to have to play the psychologist again You dont know Pitt as I do Ive competed with him and thats why Im out here He wanted to get rid of me In my case however separation is enough It may not be enough in Marlenes case
	Another forced laugh Come Siever What are you saying
	Listen and youll understand Pitt is secretive He has a fixed aversion to anyone knowing what he intends It gives him a sense of power to be moving down a hidden road and dragging others all unwitting with him
	You may be right He kept Nemesis secret and forced the secrecy on me too
	Hes got many secrets more than you and I know Im sure But heres Marlene to whom a persons hidden motives and thoughts are as clear as day No one likes thatPitt least of all So hes sent her out hereand you too since he couldnt send her without you
	All right What of that
	You dont suppose he wants her back do you Ever
	Thats paranoid Siever You cant really believe Pitt would intend to keep her in permanent exile
	He can in one way You see Eugenia you dont know the early history of the Dome as I do and as Pitt does and as hardly anyone else does You know Pitts penchant for secrecy and it works here too You have to understand why we remain in the Dome and make no effort to colonize Erythro
	You explained The character of the light 
	That is the official explanation Eugenia Accept the light it is something we can grow accustomed to Consider what else we have a world with a normal gravity a breathable atmosphere a pleasant temperature range weather cycles reminiscent of Earth no lifeforms above the prokaryote stage and with those prokaryotes not infectious in any way Yet we make no move to colonize the world even in a limited fashion
	Well then why not
	In the early days of the Dome people went out freely to explore outside They took no special precautions breathed the air drank the water
	Yes
	And some of them fell ill Mentally Permanently Not violently insane butdivorced from reality Some have improved with time but none as far as I know has recovered completely It is apparently not contagious and they are taken care of on Rotorquietly
	Eugenia frowned Are you making this up Siever I havent heard a word of it
	I remind you again of Pitts penchant for secrecy This was not something you had a need to know It was not your department It was something I had a need to know because I was sent here to deal with it If I failed we might have had to abandon Erythro altogether and a pall of fear and discontent would have fallen over us all
	He fell silent for a moment then said I shouldnt be telling you this I am in a sense violating my oath of office Still for Marlenes sake
	A look of deepest apprehension crossed Eugenias face What are you saying That Pitt
	Im saying that Pitt may have thought that Marlene might come down with what we called Erythrotic Plague It wouldnt kill her It wouldnt even make her ill in the ordinary sense but it would sufficiently disorder her brain to put her peculiar gift out of action perhaps and that is what Pitt would want
	But that is horrible Siever Unthinkable To subject a child
	Im not saying it will happen Eugenia What Pitt wants is not necessarily what Pitt will get Once I got here I introduced drastic methods of protection We dont go out in the open except in the equivalent of protective suits and we dont stay out longer than need be The filtration procedures of the Dome have been improved too Since I instituted those measures weve only had two cases both rather light
	But what causes it Siever
	Genarr laughed briefly but not lightly We dont know Thats the worst of it We cant sharpen our defenses any further Careful experiments indicate that there is nothing in either air or water that would seem to account for it Nor in the soilafter all we have the soil here in the Dome we cant divorce ourselves from it We have the air and water too properly filtered Still many people have breathed raw Erythrotic air and drunk raw Erythrotic water and have done so with complete impunity and no consequences
	Then it must be the prokaryotes
	It cant be Weve all ingested them or breathed them inadvertently and weve used them in animal experiments Nothing happens Besides if it were the prokaryotes the Plague would be expected to be contagious and as I said it isnt Weve experimented with the radiation from Nemesis and that seems to do no harm Whats more onceonly oncesomeone whod never been outside got it inside the Dome Its a mystery
	You have no theories
	I No Im just content that it has virtually stopped Still as long as we are so ignorant of the nature and cause of the Plague we can never be sure that it wont start up again There was one suggestion
	What was that
	A psychologist reported this suggestion to me and I passed it on to Pitt He claimed that those who came down with the disorder were more imaginative than those who did not more out of the ordinary mentally speaking More intelligent more creative more unusual He suggested that whatever the cause the more remarkable brains were less resistant more easily upset
	Do you think that might be so
	I dont know The trouble is that there is no other distinction Both sexes were hit roughly equally and no clear bias as far as age education or gross physical characteristics could be found Of course the Plague victims make up a relatively small sample so the statistics arent compelling Pitt thought we might go along with the outoftheusual bit and in recent years no one has come to Erythro who hasnt been a pretty dull clodnot unintelligent you understand but a plodder Like myself Im the ideal subject for immunity from the Plague an ordinary brain Right
	Come Sieveryou arent
	On the other hand said Genarr not waiting for her protest I would say that Marlenes brain was remarkably out of the ordinary
	Oh yes began Eugenia I see what youre getting at
	Its possible that when Pitt discovered that Marlene had this ability and that she was asking to go to Erythro he saw at once that by merely acceding to her request he might possibly get rid of a mind he instantly recognized as dangerous 
	Obviously then we ought to leavego back to Rotor
	Yes but Im quite sure Pitt can prevent that for a while He can insist that these measurements you wish to make are vital and must be completed and you wont be able to use the Plague as an excuse If you even try he will have you held for mental examination I would suggest that you complete those measurements as quickly as you can and as for Marlene we will take all possible precautions The Plague has died down and the suggestion that outoftheordinary brains are particularly vulnerable is just that a suggestion and no more Theres no real reason to think we cant get away with it We can keep Marlene safe and do Pitt in the eye Youll see
	Insigna stared at Genarr not quite seeing him her stomach tying itself into a knot


Sixteen Hyperspace


	Adelia was a pleasant Settlement much more pleasant than Rotor had been
	Crile Fisher had now been on six Settlements other than Rotor and all had been more pleasant than Rotor Fisher paused momentarily to go over the list of names and sighed There were seven not six He was losing track Perhaps it was all getting to be too much for him
	Whatever the number Adelia was the most pleasant Settlement Crile had visited Not perhaps physically Rotor had been an older Settlement one that had managed to work itself into an assembly of traditions so to speak There was an efficiency about it a sense of each person knowing his place exactly being satisfied with it and working away at it successfully
	Of course Tessa was here on AdeliaTessa Anita Wendel Crile had not pursued matters there yet perhaps because Tanayamas characterization of him as irresistible to women had shaken him However much it might have been meant as humor or as sarcasm it forced him almost against his will to go slowly Producing a fiasco would seem doubly bad in the eyes of someone who believed him however insincerely to have a way with women
	It was two weeks after Fisher had settled himself into the Settlement before he managed to see her It was always a source of wonder to him that on any Settlement one could always manage to arrange to get a view of anyone Not all his experience had accustomed him to the smallness of a Settlement to the fewness of its population to the manner in which everyone knew everyone else in his or her social circleeveryone elseand almost everyone else outside that circle too
	When he did see her however Tessa Wendel turned out to be rather impressive Tanayamas description of her as middleaged and as twicedivorcedthe quirk of his aged lips as he said so as though he were knowingly setting Fisher an unpleasant taskhad built a picture in Fishers mind of a harsh woman hardfaced with a nervous twitch perhaps and an attitude toward men that was either cynical or hungry
	Tessa did not seem at all like this from the moderate distance at which he first saw her She was almost as tall as he was and brunette with her hair sleeked down She looked quite alert and she smiled easilyhe could tell that Her clothes were refreshingly simple as though she went out of her way to eschew ornament She had kept herself slim and her figure was still surprisingly youthful
	Fisher found himself wondering why she was twicedivorced He was ready to assume that she had tired of the men rather than the other way around even though common sense told him that incompatibility could strike against all odds
	It was necessary to be at some social function at which she would also be present His being an Earthman interposed a small difficulty but there were people on every Settlement who were to some extent or other in Earths pay One of them would surely see to it that Fisher would be launched to use the term most Settlements applied to the ritual
	The time came then when he and Wendel were facing each other and she gazed at him thoughtfully her eyes making a slow sweep downward then upward again followed by the inevitable Youre from Earth arent you Mr Fisher
	Yes I am Dr Wendel And I regret that exceedinglyif it offends you
	It doesnt offend me I presume youve been decontaminated
	Indeed To death just about
	And why have you dared the decontamination process in order to come here
	And Fisher said without staring at her too directly but keen to detect the effect Because I was told that Adelian women were particularly beautiful
	And now I suppose you will go back and deny the rumor
	On the contrary it has just been confirmed She said Youre a fetcher you know that
	Fisher didnt know what a fetcher was in Adelian slang but Wendel was smiling and Fisher decided the first exchange had gone well
	Was it because he was irresistible He suddenly remembered that he had never tried to be irresistible to Eugenia He had merely wanted a way of being launched into the difficult Rotorian society
	The Adelian society was not so difficult Fisher decided but he had better not belabor his irresistibility Yet to himself he smiled sadly
	A month later Fisher and Wendel were sufficiently at ease with each other to spend some time together in a lowG gym Fisher had almost enjoyed the workoutbut only almost because he had never grown sufficiently acclimated to gymnastics at lowG to avoid a certain amount of space sickness On Rotor there had been less attention to such things and he had usually been excluded from them because he was not a native Rotorian That was not legal but custom often has a habit of being stronger than legality
	They took an elevator to a higherG level and Fisher felt his stomach settling down Both he and Wendel were wearing a minimum of clothing and he had the feeling that she was as aware of his body as he was of hers
	After their showers they had both robed and retired to one of the Privacies where they could order a small meal
	Wendel said Youre not bad at lowG for an Earthman Crile Are you enjoying yourself on Adelia
	You know I am Tessa An Earthman can never get entirely used to a small world but your presence would overbalance a great many disadvantages 
	Yes Thats exactly what a fetcher would say How does Adelia compare to Rotor
	To Rotor
	Or to the other Settlements youve been on I can name them all Crile
	Fisher felt discomfited What did you do Investigate me
	Of course
	Am I that interesting
	I find anyone interesting who is clearly going out of his way to be interested in me I want to know why Excluding the possibility of sex of course Thats taken as a given
	Why am I interested in you then
	Suppose you tell me Why were you on Rotor You were there long enough to get married and have a child and then you got off in a hurry before it scooted away Were you afraid of being stuck on Rotor all your life Didnt you like it there
	Fisher had gone from feeling discomfited to feeling harassed He said Actually I didnt like Rotor very much because they didnt like meEarthmen that is And youre right I didnt want to be stuck there as a secondclass citizen all my life Other Settlements are easier on us Adelia is
	Rotor had a secret though that it was trying to keep from Earth didnt it Wendels eyes seemed to glitter with amusement
	A secret You mean I suppose hyperassistance
	Yes I suppose that is what I mean And I suppose that that was what you were after
	I
	Yes of course you Did you get it I mean thats why you married a Rotorian scientist wasnt it She rested her face on her two fists elbows on the table and leaned toward him
	Fisher shook his head and said guardedly She never said a word to me about hyperassistance Youre all wrong about me
	Wendel ignored his remark and said  And now you want to get it from me How do you plan to do that Are you going to marry me
	Would I get it from you if I married you
	No
	Then marriage seems to be out of the question doesnt it
	Too bad said Wendel smiling
	Fisher said  Are you asking me these questions because youre a hyperspatialist
	Where were you told that that was what I was Back on Earth before you came here
	Youre listed in the Adelian Roster 
	Ah youve investigated me too What a curious pair we are Did you notice that I was listed as a theoretical physicist
	It also lists your papers and when quite a few of the titles have the word hyperspatial it makes you sound like a hyperspatialist to me
	Yes but Im a theoretical physicist just the same so I approach the whole matter of hyperspatialism in a theoretical way Ive never tried to put it into practice
	But Rotor did Did that bother you I wonder After all someone on Rotor got ahead of you
	Why should it bother me The theory is interesting but the application isnt If you were to read more of my papers than the titles you would discover that I say quite flatly that hyperassistance isnt worth the effort
	Rotorians were able to get a vessel far into space and studied the stars
	Youre talking about the Far Probe That enabled Rotor to get parallax measurements for a number of comparatively distant stars but is that worth the expense they went to How far did the Far Probe go Just a few lightmonths Thats not really very far As far as the Galaxy is concerned the Far Probes extreme position and that of Earth and the imaginary line that can be drawn between them all amounts to a point in space
	They did more than send out the Far Probe said Fisher The entire Settlement left
	They certainly did That was in  so theyve been gone six years now And all we know is that they left
	Isnt that enough
	Of course not Where did they go Are they still alive Can they still be alive Human beings have never been isolated on a Settlement They have always had Earth in the vicinity and other Settlements too Can a few tens of thousands of human beings survive alone in the Universe on a small Settlement We have no idea if that is a psychological possibility My guess is that it isnt
	I imagine their purpose would be to find a world they could live on They wouldnt remain on a Settlement
	Come what world will they find Theyve been gone six years There are exactly two stars they could have reached by now since hyperassistance can only move them at an average speed equal to that of light Thats Alpha Centauri a threestar system fourpointthree lightyears away one of the three being a red dwarf Then theres Barnards star a single red dwarf fivepointnine lightyears away Four stars a Sunlike star a nearSunlike star and two red dwarfs The two Sunlikes are part of a moderately close binary and therefore unlikely to have an Earthlike planet in stable orbit Where do they go next They wont make it Crile Im sorry I know that your wife and child were on Rotor but they wont make it
	Fisher kept calm He knew something she didnt He knew about the Neighbor Starbut that was a red dwarf too
	He said Then you think that interstellar flight is impossible
	In a practical sense yes if hyperassistance is all there is
	Fisher said You make it sound as though hyperassistance isnt all there is Tessa
	It may be all there is It wasnt long ago when we thought that even that much was impossible and to go further yetStill we can at least dream of true hyperspatial flight and true superluminal velocities If we could go as quickly as we wished for as long as we wished then the Galaxy perhaps the Universe would become one large Solar System so to speak and we could have it all
	Thats a nice dream but is it possible
	Weve had three AllSettlement Conferences on the matter since Rotors flight
	Just AllSettlement What about Earth
	There were Earth observers present but Earth is not a physicists paradise these days
	What conclusions did the conferences reach Wendel smiled Youre not a physicist
	Leave out the hard parts Im curious She merely smiled at him
	Fisher clenched his fist on the table before him Forget this theory of yours that Im some sort of secret agent after your information I have a child out there somewhere Tessa You say shes probably dead What if shes alive Is there a chance
	Wendels smile disappeared Im sorry I did not think of that But be practical Finding a Settlement somewhere in a volume of space that is represented by a sphere that at the present time is six lightyears in radius and is growing ever larger with time is an impossible task It took us over a century to find the tenth planet and that was enormously larger than Rotor and a much smaller volume of space had to be combed
	Fisher said Hope springs eternal Is true hyperspatial flight possible You can say yes or no
	Most say naif you want the truth There may be a few who say they cant say but they tend to mumble
	Does anyone say yes right out loud
	One person that I know of does I do
	You think its possible said Fisher with an astonishment he did not have to fake Do you say that openly or is it something you tell yourself in the dark of the night
	Ive published on the subject One of those articles you only read the title of No one dares agree with me of course and Ive been wrong before but I think Im right now
	Why do the others all think youre wrong
	Thats the hard part Its a matter of interpretation Hyperassistance on the Rotorian model the techniques of which are by now understood in the Settlements generally by the way depends on the fact that the product of the ratio of ship speed to light speed multiplied by time is a constant where the ratio of ship speed to light speed is greater than one
	What does that mean
	That means that when you go faster than light the faster you go the shorter the time you can maintain that speed and the longer the time you must go more slowly than light before you can get a boost over it again The result is that in the end your average speed over a particular distance is no greater than the speed of light
	Well
	That makes it sound as though the uncertainty principle is involved and the uncertainty principle all of us are convinced cant be fooled with If the uncertainty principle is involved then true hyperspatial flight would seem to be theoretically impossible and most physicists have come down on that side of the argument while the rest of them waffle My view however is that whats involved merely seems like the uncertainty principle but isnt and that true hyperspatial flight is therefore not eliminated
	Can the matter be settled
	Probably not said Wendel shaking her head The Settlements are definitely not interested in wandering off with mere hyperassistance No one is going to repeat the Rotorian experiment and voyage for years to probable death On the other hand neither is any Settlement going to invest an incredible amount of money resources and effort in order to try to work out a technique that the vast majority of experts in the field are convinced is theoretically impossible
	Fisher leaned forward Doesnt that bother you
	Of course it bothers me Im a physicist and Id like to prove that my view of the Universe is the correct one However Ive got to accept the limits of the possible It will take enormous sums and the Settlements will give me nothing
	But Tessa even if the Settlements are not interested Earth isand to any amount
	Really Tessa smiled in what seemed mild amusement and she reached out to stroke Fishers hair slowly and sensually I thought wed get to Earth eventually
	Fisher seized Wendels wrist and gently drew her hand away from his head He said Youve been telling me the truth about your opinions of hyperspatial flight havent you
	Completely
	He said Then Earth wants you
	Why
	Because Earth wants hyperspatial flight and youre the one important physicist who thinks it can be done
	If you knew that Crile why the crossexamination
	I didnt know it until you told me so The only information I had been given was that you were the most brilliant physicist alive today
	Oh I am I am said Wendel mockingly And you were sent to get me
	I was sent to persuade you
	Persuade me to do what To come to Earth Overcrowded filthy impoverished wracked by uncontrolled weather What an enticing thought
	Listen to me Tessa Earth is not all of a piece It may have all those faults but there are parts that are beautiful and peaceful and that is all you would see You dont really know what Earth is like Youve never been there have you
	Never Im Adelian born and bred I have been to other Settlements but Ive never been to Earth thank you
	Then you cant know what Earth is like You cant know what a large world is A real world You live here enclosed in a toy box with a few square kilometers of surface with a handful of people Youre living in a miniature that youve used up long ago and that has nothing more to offer you Earth on the other hand is over six hundred million square kilometers of surface It is eight billion human beings It is infinite varietylots of it very bad but lots of it very good
	And all of it very poor And you have no science
	Because scientistsand with them sciencehave moved out to the Settlements Thats why we need you and others Come back to Earth 
	I still dont see why
	Because we have goals ambitions desires The Settlements have only selfsatisfaction
	What good are all those goals and ambitions and desires Physics is an expensive pursuit
	And Earths per capita wealth is low I admit it Individually we are poor but eight billion people each contributing something out of poverty can amass a vast sum Our resources misused as they are and have been are still enormous and we can find more money and more labor than all the Settlements togetherif it is for something we feel an absolute need I assure you that Earth feels an absolute need for hyperspatial flight Come to Earth Tessa and you will be treated as that rarest of resources a brilliant brain we must haveand the one thing we cant supply on our own
	Wendel said Im not at all sure that Adelia would be willing to let me go It may be a selfsatisfied Settlement but it knows the value of brains too
	They cant object to your attending a scientific meeting on Earth
	And once there you mean I neednt return
	You will have no complaint with regard to treatment You will be more comfortable there than you are here Your every desire your every wishMore than that you can head the hyperspatial project and you will have an unlimited budget to devise tests of any kind run experiments make observations
	Well What a princely bribe you offer me
	Fisher said earnestly Is there anything more you can ask for
	I wonder said Wendel Why were you sent An attractive man like you Were they expecting you to bring back an elderly female physicistsusceptiblefrustrateddrawn by your body like a fish by a hook
	I dont know what was in the mind of those who sent me Tessa but that was not in my mind Not after one look at you You are not elderly as you well know I dont for a minute believe that you are either susceptible or frustrated Earth is offering you a physicists dream That has nothing to do with whether you are male or female elderly or youthful
	What a shame Suppose I proved recalcitrant and didnt wish to go to Earth What were you to do as a last measure of persuasion Suppress your distaste for the process and make love to me
	Wendel crossed her arms over her magnificent breasts and looked at him quizzically
	Fisher said carefully choosing his words  Again I cannot say what was in the mind of those who sent me Making love was not part of my explicit instructions nor was it part of my intentions though if it had been I assure you that I would feel no distaste at the prospect I felt however that you would see the advantages from a physicists point of view and I would not denigrate you by supposing that you would need anything more
	How wrong you are said Wendel I see the advantages from a physicists point of view and I am anxious to accept the offer and to pursue the butterfly of hyperspatial flight down the corridors of the possiblebut I do not wish to give up your best efforts at persuasion either I want it all
	But
	In short if you want me you must pay me Persuade me as though I were recalcitrant as best as ever you can or I wont go to Earth Come why do you suppose we are here in a Privacy What do you think Privacies are for Once we have exercised showered eaten a bit drank a little conversed experienced some pleasure in all these things there is opportunity to experience others I insist Persuade me to come to Earth 
	And at the touch of her finger the light within the Privacy dimmed seductively


Seventeen Safe


	Insigna felt uneasy It was Siever Genarr who had insisted that Marlene be consulted in the matter
	He said Youre her mother Eugenia and you cant help but think of her as a little girl It takes a while for a mother to realize she is not an absolute monarch that her daughter is not a piece of property
	Eugenia Insigna avoided his mild eye She said Dont lecture me Siever You have no children of your own Its easy to be pompous about other peoples children
	Do I sound pompous Im sorry Let us say Im not as emotionally bound as you are to the memory of an infant I like the girl a great deal but I have no picture of her in my mind except that of a burgeoning young woman with a very remarkable mind Shes important Eugenia I have a peculiar feeling that she is much more important than either you or I She must be consulted
	She must be kept safe  Insigna countered
	I agree but she must be consulted as to how best to keep her safe She is young she is inexperienced but she may possibly know better than we do what must be done Let us talk among ourselves as though we were three adults Promise me Eugenia that you wont try to make use of maternal authority
	Insigna said bitterly How can I promise that But well talk to her
	So now the three were together in Genarrs office the room shielded and Marlene looking quickly from one to the other pressed her lips tightly together and said unhappily Im not going to like this
	Insigna said Im afraid it is bad news Here it isbluntly Were considering a return to Rotor
	Marlene looked astonished But your important work Mother You cant abandon that But I see you dont intend to I dont understand then
	Marlene Insigna spoke slowly and with emphasis Were considering that you return to Rotor Only you 
	At that there were a few moments of silence while Marlene searched both of their faces Then she said almost in a whisper Youre serious I cant believe it I wont return to Rotor I dont want to Ever Erythro is my world Right here is where I want to be
	Marlene began Insigna her voice shrill
	Genarr held up his hand in Insignas direction shaking his head slightly She fell silent and Genarr said Why are you so anxious to be here Marlene
	And Marlene answered flatly Because I am You can be hungry for some particular food sometimesjust feel like eating it You cant explain why You just want it Im hungry for Erythro I dont know why but I want it I dont have to explain that
	Genarr said Let your mother tell you what we know
	Insigna took Marlenes cold and unresponsive hand in hers and said Do you remember Marlene before we left for Erythro when you were telling me about your conversation with Commissioner Pitt
	Yes
	You told me then that when he said we could go to Erythro he left out something You didnt know what that something was but you said it was rather unpleasantsort of evil
	Yes I remember
	Insigna hesitated and Marlenes large penetrating eyes grew hard She whispered as though she was talking to herself and wasnt entirely aware that her inner thoughts were being voiced Optic flicker at head Hand nearly at temple Moves away The sound died though her lips continued to move
	Then in loud outrage she said  Are you under the impression theres something wrong with my mind
	No said Insigna quickly Quite the reverse dear We know that your mind is an excellent one and we want it to stay that way Heres the story
	Marlene listened to the tale of the Erythro Plague with what seemed to be the deepest suspicion and finally said I see you believe what you are telling me Mother but it could be that someone told you a lie
	She heard it from me said Genarr and I tell you of my personal experience that its all the truth Now you tell me if I am telling the truth right now
	Marlene clearly accepted that and moved onward Why am I in particular danger then Why am I in danger more than you or Mother
	As your mother said MarleneThe Plague is thought to strike more readily at people who are more imaginative more fanciful There is evidence that leads some to believe that unusual minds are more susceptible to the Plague and since yours is the most unusual I have ever encountered it seems to me possible that you are dangerously susceptible The Commissioner has sent instructions that you are to have a free hand on Erythro that were to make it possible for you to see and experience whatever you wish that we are even to allow you to explore outside the Domeif that is your desire It sounds very kind of him but might he not want to expose you to the outside in the wish in the hope of increasing your chance at coming down with the Plague
	Marlene considered this with no sign of emotion Insigna said Dont you see Marlene The Commissioner doesnt want to kill you Were not accusing him of that He just wants to put your mind out of action It is inconvenient to him You can easily find out things about him and about his intentions that he doesnt want you to know and he wont have that Hes a man of secrets
	If Commissioner Pitt is trying to do me harm said Marlene at length then why are you trying to send me back to him
	Genarr raised his eyebrows Weve explained it Youre in danger here
	Id be in danger there with him What might he do nextif he really wants to destroy me If he thinks Im going to be destroyed here then hell forget about me Hell leave me alone wont he At least for as long as Im here
	But the Plague Marlene The Plague  She reached out to hug her Marlene evaded the embrace Im not worried about the Plague
	But we explained
	It doesnt matter what you explained Im not in danger here Not at all I know my mind Ive lived with it all my life I understand it Its not in danger
	Genarr said Be reasonable Marlene However stable you feel your mind to be its subject to disease and deterioration You might get meningitis epileptic symptoms a brain tumor or eventually senescence Can you hold any of those things at bay just by being sure none of it will happen to you
	Im not talking about any of those things Im talking about the Plague That wont happen to me
	You cant possibly be sure dear We dont even know what the Plague is
	Whatever it is it wont happen to me
	How can you tell Marlene asked Genarr I just know
	Insigna felt her patience break She caught Marlene by both elbows Marlene you must do as youre told
	No Mother You dont understand On Rotor Ive felt a pull toward Erythro It pulls me more strongly than ever now that Im on it I want to stay on it Ill be safe here I dont want to go back to Rotor Ill be less safe there
	Genarr raised his hand stopping whatever it was that Insigna was about to say I suggest a compromise Marlene Your mother is here to make certain astronomical observations It will take her some time Promise that while she is busy at it you will be content to stay inside the Dome and take such precautions as I think will make sense and that you submit to periodic tests If we detect no change in your mental functioning you can wait here in the Dome till your mother is done and then we can discuss it again Agreed
	Marlene bent her head in thought Then she said  All right But Mother dont think of pretending to be finished when youre not finished I will know And dont think of doing a quick job instead of a good one I will know that too
	Insignia frowned and said I wont play games Marlene and dont think I will ever deliberately do bad scienceeven for your sake
	Marlene said Im sorry Mother I know that you find me irritating
	Insignia sighed heavily I dont deny that but irritating or not Marlene you are my daughter I love you and I want to keep you safe As far as that goes am I lying
	No Mother you are not lying but please believe me when I say I am safe Since Ive been on Erythro Ive been happy I never was happy on Rotor
	Genarr said And why are you happy
	I dont know Uncle Siever But being happy is enough even when you dont know why isnt it
	You look tired Eugenia said Genarr
	Not physically Siever Just tired inside after two months of calculations I dont know how it was possible for astronomers in prespatial times to do what they did with nothing more than primitive computers For that matter Kepler worked out the laws of planetary motion with nothing more than logarithms and had to consider himself fortunate that they had just been invented
	Pardon a nonastronomer but I thought that these days astronomers simply gave their instruments their directions then went to sleep and after a few hours woke up and found everything printed up neatly and waiting at the desk
	I wish But this job was different Do you know how precisely I had to clculate the actual velocity of Nemesis and the Sun relative to each other so that I could know exactly where and when the two made their closest approach Do you know how tiny an error would be sufficient to make it seem that Nemesis would do Earth no harm when it would really destroy itand vice versa
	It would be bad enough Insignia went on intensely if Nemesis and the Sun were the only two bodies in the Universe but there are nearby stars all of them moving At least a dozen of them are massive enough to have a tiny effect on Nemesis or the Sun or both Tiny but large enough to mount up to an error of millions of kilometers one way or another if ignored And in order to get it right you have to know the mass of each star with considerable precision and its position and its velocity
	Its a fifteenbody problem Siever enormously complicated Nemesis will go right through the Solar System and have a perceptible effect on several of the planets A lot depends on the actual position of each planet in its orbit as Nemesis passes through of course and by how much it will shift under the influence of Nemesis gravity and how this shift will affect its pull on the other planets And by the way the effect of Megas also has to be calculated
	Genarr listened gravely  And whats the bottom line Eugenia
	As it happens I believe the effect will be to make Earths orbit a trifle more eccentric than it is now and the semimajor axis a bit smaller than it is now
	Which means
	Which means that Earth will become too hot to be habitable
	And what will happen to Megas and Erythro
	Nothing measurable The Nemetic System is much smaller than the Solar System and therefore is held together more tightly Nothing here will budge significantly but Earth will
	When will this happen
	In five thousand and twentyfour years plus or minus fifteen Nemesis will reach the point of closest approach The effect will spread itself out over twenty or thirty years as Nemesis and the Sun approach and separate
	Are there going to be any collisions or anything like that
	Almost zero chance of anything significant No collisions between any major bodies Of course a solar asteroid might strike Erythro or a Nemetic asteroid might strike the Earth There would be a very small chance of that though it would be catastrophic for Earth if it happened Theres no chance of calculating that however until the stars are very close to each other
	But in any case Earth will have to be evacuated Is that it
	Oh yes
	But theyve got five thousand years to do it in
	Five thousand years is none too long to arrange for the evacuation of eight billion people They should be warned
	Wont they find out for themselves even if they arent warned
	Who knows when And even if they find out soon we should give them the technique of hyperassistance They will have to have it
	Im sure they will have that on their own too and perhaps in not too long a time
	And if they dont
	Im also sure that within a century or less communication will be established between Rotor and Earth After all if we have hyperassistance for transportation we will have it for communication eventually Or we will send a Settlement back to Earth and there will still be time
	You talk like Pitt
	Genarr chuckled He cant be wrong all the time you know
	He wont want to communicate I know it
	He cant always have his way either We have a Dome here on Erythro though he opposed it And even if we dont beat him on that hell be dead eventually Really Eugenia dont worry excessively about Earth at this moment We have nearer concerns Does Marlene know you are about done
	How can she fail to know Apparently the exact state of my progress is imprinted on the way I swish my sleeve or comb my hair
	Shes getting ever more perceptive isnt she
	Yes Have you noticed that too
	Indeed I have Just in the short time Ive known her
	I suppose part of it is due to her growing older Shes growing perception perhaps the way shes growing breasts Then too she spent most of her life trying to hide her ability because she didnt know what to make of it and because it got her into trouble Now that shes not afraid its out and expanding so to speak
	Or because for some reason as she says she likes being on Erythro and her pleasure extends her perceptions
	Insigna said I have had a thought about this Siever I dont wish to pester you with my follies I do tend to accumulate worries about Marlene about Earth about everythingDo you suppose that Erythro is affecting her I mean adversely Do you suppose that a touch of the Plague is taking the form of making her even more perceptive
	I dont know that that question can be answered Eugenia but if her heightened perception is the effect of the Plague it doesnt seem to bother her mental balance at all And I can tell you thisnone of those who suffered from the Plague in all our stay here showed any symptoms remotely like Eugenias gift
	Insigna heaved a sigh Thank you Youre comforting And thank you too for being so gentle and friendly with Marlene
	Genarrs mouth quirked in a small lopsided smile Its easy Im very fond of her
	You make that sound so natural Shes not a likable girl I know that even if Im her mother
	I find her likable Ive always preferred brains to beauty in women unless I could get both as in your case Eugenia
	Twenty years ago maybe said Eugenia with another sigh
	My eyes have aged with your body Eugenia They see no change But it doesnt matter to me that Marlene is not beautiful Shes fearfully intelligent even apart from her perception
	Yes there is that It consoles me even when she is most burdensome
	Well as to that Im afraid Marlene will continue to be a burden Eugenia
	Insigna looked up sharply In what way
	She has made it plain to me that being in the Dome is not enough She wants to be out there out on the soil of the world itself just as soon as you are done with your work She insists
	And Insigna stared at him in horror


Eighteen Superluminal


	Three years on Earth had aged Tessa Wendel Her complexion had coarsened a bit She had put on some weight There was the beginning of jowls and dark patches under her eyes Her breasts had grown a shade pendulous and her waist had thickened
	Crile Fisher knew that Tessa was in her late forties now that she was five years older than he was But she did not look older than her years She was still a fine mature figure of a woman as he had heard someone refer to her but she would no longer pass for a woman in her thirties as she might easily have done when he had first met her at Adelia
	Tessa was aware of it too and had spoken of it bitterly to him only the week before
	Its you Crile she had said one night when they were in bed together a time when apparently she was most conscious of aging The fault is yours You sold me on Earth Magnificent you said Enormous you said Variety Always something new Inexhaustible 
	And isnt it he said knowing what she found objectionable but willing to let her vent her feelings once again
	Not where gravity is concerned Allover this entire bloated impossible planet you have the same gravitational pull Up in the air down in a mine here there everywhere one Gone Gone G It should kill you all out of sheer boredom
	We know no better Tessa
	You know better Youve been on Settlements There you can pick your gravitational pull to suit yourself You can exercise at low gravity You can lighten the strain on your tissues now and then How can you Jive without that
	We exercise here on Earth too
	Oh pleaseyou do it with that pull that eternal pull yanking down on you You spend all your time fighting it instead of letting your muscles interplay You cant leap you cant fly you cant soar You cant let yourself drop into the greater pull or rise into the lesser one And that pull pull pull drags every bit of you down so that you sag and wrinkle and age Look at me Look at me
	I look at you as often as I can said Fisher solemnly
	Dont look at me then If you do youll throw me over And if you do that Ill go back to Adelia
	No you wont What will you do there after youve exercised at low gravity Your research work your laboratories your team are all here
	Ill start over and build a new team
	And will Adelia support you in the style to which you are now accustomed Of course not Youll have to admit that Earth is not stinting you that you are getting all you want Wasnt I right
	Werent you right Traitor You didnt tell me that Earth had hyperassistance You also didnt tell me that they had discovered the Neighbor Star In fact you let me pontificate on the uselessness of Rotors Far Probe and never once told me that it had discovered anything more than a few parallaxes You sat there and laughed at me like the heartless wretch you are
	I would have told you Tessa but what if you had decided not to come to Earth It was not my secret to give you
	But after I came to Earth
	As soon as you got to work actually to work we told you
	They told me and left me feeling stunned and foolish You might have given me just a hint so that I wouldnt come off like such an idiot I should have killed you but what could I do Youre addictive You knew you were when you heartlessly seduced me into coming to Earth
	That was a game she insisted on playing and Fisher knew his role He said Seduced you You insisted You wouldnt have it any other way
	You liar You forced yourself on me It was rapeimpure and complex And youre going to do it again I can see it in those dreadfullustfilled eyes
	It had been months since she had played that particular game and Fisher knew it came when she was satisfied with herself professionally He said afterward Have you made progress
	Progress I think you can call it that She was panting I have a demonstration that Ive set up for tomorrow for your decaying and ancient Earthman Tanayama Hes been pushing for it mercilessly
	Hes a merciless fellow
	Hes a stupid fellow Youd think that even if a society doesnt know science they would know something about science about how it works If they give you a million global credits in the morning they shouldnt expect anything definite by evening the same day They should at least wait till the next morning and give you the whole night to work in Do you know what he said to me last time we spoke when I said I might have something to show him
	No you hadnt told me What did he say
	Youd think hed say Its amazing that in a mere three years youve worked out something so astonishing and new We must give you enormous credit and the weight of gratitude we feel toward you is immeasurable Thats what you would think he would say
	No not in a million years would I think that Tanayama would say anything like that What did he say
	He said So you have something finally after three years I should hope so How long do you think I have to live Do you think I have been supporting you and paying for you and feeding you an army of assistants and workers in order to have you produce something after Im dead and cant see it Thats what he did say and I tell you I would like to delay the demonstration till he is dead for my own satisfaction but I suppose that the work comes first
	Do you really have something that will satisfy him
	Only superluminal flight True superluminal flight not that hyperassistance nonsense We now have something that will open the door to the Universe
	The site where Tessa Wendels research team labored intent on shaking the Universe had been prepared for her even before she had been recruited and come to Earth It was inside a vast mountainous redoubt that was totally offlimits to Earths teeming population and in it a veritable city of research had been built
	And now Tanayama was there seated in a motorized chair Only his eyes behind their narrowed lids seemed alivesharp glancing this way and that
	He was by no means the highest figure in Earths government not even the highest figure then present but he had been and still was the force behind the project and all automatically gave way to him
	Only Wendel seemed unintimidated
	His voice was a rustling whisper What will I see Doctor A ship
	There was no ship in view of course
	Wendel said No ship Director Ships are years away I have only a demonstration but it is an exciting one You will see the first public demonstration of true superluminal flight something that is far beyond hyperassistance
	How am I going to see that
	It was my understanding Director that you have been briefed Tanayama coughed wrackingly and had to pause to catch his breath They tried to talk to me he said but I want it from you His eyes baleful and hard were fixed on her Youre in charge he said It is your scheme Explain
	I cant explain the theory That would take too long Director It would tire you
	I want no theory What am I going to see 
	What you are going to see are two cubical glass containers Both contain a hard vacuum
	Why a vacuum
	Superluminal flight can only be initiated in a vacuum Director Otherwise the object made to move faster than light drags matter with it increasing energy expenditures and decreasing controllability It must end in a vacuum too or else the results can be catastrophic because
	Never mind the because If this superluminal flight of yours must begin and end in a vacuum how do we make use of it
	It is necessary first to move out into outer space by ordinary flight and then move into hyperspace and stay there You arrive near your destination and move out into ordinary space and then make the final move by ordinary flight
	That takes time
	Even superluminal flight cant be done instantaneously but if you can move from the Solar System to a star forty lightyears away in forty days rather than forty years it would be ungrateful to grumble over the time lapse
	All right then You have these two cubical glass containers What of them
	They are holographic projections Actually they are three thousand kilometers apart through the body of the Earth each in a mountain fastness If light could travel from one to the other through unobstructed vacuum it would take that light fully th of a secondone millisecondto make the passage Were not going to use light of course Suspended in the middle of the cube at the left held in space by a powerful magnetic field is a small sphere which is actually a tiny hyperatomic motor Do you see it Director
	I see something there said Tanayama Is that all you have
	If you will watch carefully you will see that it will disappear The countdown is progressing
	It was a whisper in each persons ear and at zero the sphere was gone from one cube and present in the other
	Remember said Wendel those cubes are really three thousand kilometers apart The timing mechanism shows that the duration between the departure and the arrival was a little over ten microseconds which means that the passage took place at almost a hundred times the speed of light
	Tanayama looked up How can I tell The whole thing could be a trick designed to fool someone you believe to be a gullible old man 
	Director said Wendel sternly There are hundreds of scientists here all with reputations a number of them Earthmen They will show you anything you want to see explain how the instruments work You will find nothing here but honest science done well
	Even if all is as you say what does it mean A little ball A Ping Pong ball traveling a few thousand kilometers Is that what you have after three years
	What you have seen is perhaps more than anyone had a right to expect Director with all due respect What you have seen may be the size of a PingPong ball and it may have traveled no more than three thousand kilometers but it is true superluminal flight just as much as if we had moved a starship from here to Arcturus at a hundred times the speed of light What you have seen is the first public demonstration of true superluminal flight in human history
	But its the starship I want to see
	For that you will have to wait
	I have no time I have no time rasped Tanayama in a voice that was nothing more than a hoarse whisper A fit of coughing shook him again
	And Wendel said in a low voice that perhaps only Tanayama heard Even your will cannot move the Universe
	The three days devoted to officialdom in what was unofficially known as Hyper City had passed grindingly and now the interlopers were gone
	Even so said Tessa Wendel to Crile Fisher it will take two or three more days to recover and get back to work with full intensity She looked haggard and intensely displeased as she said What a vile old man
	Fisher had no trouble divining the reference to be to Tanayama Hes a sick old man
	Wendel shot an angry look at him  Are you defending him
	Just stating a fact Tessa
	She lifted a finger in admonishment I am quite certain that that miserable relic was as irrational and unreasonable in days past when he was not sick or for that matter when he was not old How long has he been Director of the Office
	Hes a fixture Over thirty years And before that he was Chief Deputy for almost as long and probably the real power behind a succession of three or four figurehead Directors And no matter how old or sick he gets hell stay Director till he diesmaybe for three days afterward while people wait to make sure he doesnt rise from the dead
	I gather you think this is funny
	No but what can you do but laugh at the spectacle of a man who without open power without even being known to the general public has kept everyone in the government in fear and subjection for nearly half a century simply because he has firm control over everyones disreputable secrets and would not hesitate to make use of them
	And they endure him
	Oh yes Theres not a person in the government who has ever been willing to sacrifice his own career with certainty merely on the chance of bringing down Tanayama
	Even now when his hold on matters must be growing tenuous
	Youre making a mistake His grip may fail with death but until his actual death that grip of his will never be tenuous It will be the last that goes sometime after his heart stops
	What drives people so asked Wendel with distaste Is there no desire to let go early enough to have a chance to die in peace
	Not Tanayama Never I wouldnt say Im an intimate of his but in fifteen years or so I have made contact with him now and then never without being badly bruised in the process I knew him when he was still vigorous and I always knew he would never stop To answer your earlier question different things drive different people but in Tanayamas case its hatred
	I should think so said Wendel It shows No one that hateful can fail to hate But who does Tanayama hate
	The Settlements
	Oh he does Wendel was obviously remembering that she was a Settler from Adelia Ive never heard a Settler say a kind word for Earth either And you know my feelings for anyplace without variable gravity
	Im not talking dislike Tessa or distaste or contempt Im talking blind scarlet hatred Almost any Earthman dislikes the Settlements They have all the latest Theyre quiet uncrowded comfortable middleclass They have ample food ample recreation no bad weather no poor They have robots that are kept smoothly out of sight Its only natural for people who consider themselves deprived to dislike those who seem to have everything But with Tanayama its active boiling hatred I think he would like to see the Settlements destroyed everyone
	Why Crile
	My own theory is that what gets him is none of the things I have listed What he cant stand is the cultural homogeneity of the Settlements Do you know what I mean
	No
	The people of the Settlements select themselves They select people like themselves Theres a shared culture even to some extent a shared physical appearance on each Settlement Earth on the other hand is and through all of history has been a wild mixture of cultures all enriching each other competing with each other suspicious of each other Tanayama and many other Earthmenmyself for instanceconsider such a mixture to be a source of strength and feel that cultural homogeneity on the Settlements weakens them and in the long run shortens their potential life span
	Well then why hate the Settlements for possessing something you consider a disadvantage to them Does Tanayama hate us for being better off and for being worse off It doesnt make sense
	It doesnt have to Who would bother hating if it had to be reasoned out into sensibleness first Perhapsjust perhapsTanayama is afraid that the Settlements will succeed too well and will prove cultural homogeneity to be a good thing after all Or perhaps he thinks that the Settlements are as anxious to destroy the Earth as he himself is to destroy the Settlements The matter of the Neighbor Star infuriated him
	The fact that Rotor discovered the Neighbor Star and did not inform the rest of us
	More than that They did not bother to warn us that it was speeding toward the Solar System
	They might not have known I suppose
	Tanayama would never believe that Im sure that he feels that they knew and deliberately refused to warn us hoping that we would be caught unprepared and that Earth or at least Earths civilization would be destroyed
	Has it been decided that the Neighbor Star will approach closely enough to damage us I havent heard that Its my understanding that most astronomers think it will pass at a great enough distance to leave us substantially untouched Have you heard differently
	Fisher shrugged No I havent but I think it feeds Tanayamas hatred to believe that there is danger here And from that you move logically to the notion that superluminal flight is what we must have in order to locate an Earthlike world elsewhere Then we can transfer as much of Earths population as possible to that other worldif the worst comes to worst Youll have to admit thats sensible
	It is but you dont have to imagine destruction Crile It is a natural feeling that humanity ought to spread outward even if Earth remains perfectly safe Weve moved out to the Settlements and reaching for the stars is a logical next step and for that next step we must have superluminal travel
	Yes but Tanayama would find that a cold view The colonization of the Galaxy is something Im sure he is willing to leave to generations to come What he wants for himself is to find Rotor and punish it for having abandoned the Solar System without regard for the rest of the human community He wants to live to see that and thats why he keeps pushing you Tessa
	He can push all he wants and it wont help him Hes a dying man
	I wonder Modern medical procedures can perform marvels and Im sure the doctors will go all out for Tanayama
	Even modern medicine can only go so far I asked the doctors
	And they answered I would have supposed that the question of Tanayamas health was a state secret
	Not to me under the circumstances Crile I went to the medical team that attended the Old Man here and told them that I was anxious to build an actual ship capable of carrying human beings to the stars and that I wanted to do so before Tanayama died I asked them how much time I had
	And what did they say
	I had a year Thats what they said At the most They urged me to hurry
	Can you do it in one year
	In one year Of course not Crile and Im glad of it I find pleasure in the fact that that poisonous person wont live to see it What are you making faces about Crile Does it bother you that I make so cruel a remark
	Its a petty remark anyway Tessa That Old Man however poisonous has done all this Hes made Hyper City possible
	Yes but for his own purposes not mine And not Earths or humanitys And Im allowed to have my pettiness too I am sure that Director Tanayama never once pitied anyone he considered his enemy or lightened the pressure of his foot on that enemys throat by a dyne And I imagine he doesnt expect pity or mercy from anyone else He would probably despise as a weakling anyone who offered it
	Fisher still looked unhappy How long will it take Tessa
	How can anyone say It might take forever Even if everything broke reasonably well I dont see how it could take less than five years at the least
	But why You already have superluminal flight
	Wendel sat up straight No Crile Dont be naive All I have is a laboratory demonstration I can take a light objecta Ping Pong ball in which a tiny hyperatomic motor makes up  percent of the mass and move it superluminally A ship however with people aboard is a totally different thing Well have to be certain and for that five years is optimistic I tell you that before the days of modern computers and the kind of simulations they make possible five years would be an unrealizable dream Even fifty years might have been
	Crile Fisher shook his head and said nothing
	Tessa Wendel watched him thoughtfully then said almost testily Whats the matter with you Are you in such a great hurry also
	Fisher said soothingly Im sure youre as anxious to get this done as anyone but I do long for a practical hyperspatial ship
	You more than someone else
	I quite a bit
	Why
	Id like to go to the Neighbor Star
	She glared at him Why Are you dreaming of reuniting with the wife you abandoned
	Fisher had never discussed Eugenia with Tessa Wendel in any detail and he had no intention of being trapped into it now
	He said I have a daughter out there I think you can understand that Tessa You have a son
	So she did He was in his early twenties attending Adelia University and he occasionally wrote his mother
	Wendels face softened Crile she said you mustnt allow yourself false hopes in this Ill grant you that since they knew about the Neighbor Star thats where they went With merely hyperassistance however the trip must have taken over two years We cant be sure that Rotor survived such a trip And even if they did the chances of finding a suitable planet around a red dwarf star is just about zero Having survived that far they might then have traveled on in search of a suitable planet Where And how would we find them
	I imagine they knew there was no hope for a suitable planet around the Neighbor Star Wouldnt they have been prepared therefore simply to put Rotor into a suitable orbit around the star
	Even if they survived the flight and even if they went into orbit around the star it would be a sterile life and there might be no possibility of continuing it for long in any form compatible with civilization Crile youve got to steel yourself What if we manage to organize the expedition to the Neighbor Star and find nothing at all or at most the empty hulk of what is left of Rotor
	Fisher said In that case that would be that But surely there must be a chance that they survived
	And that youll find your child Dear Crile is it safe to build your hopes on that Even if Rotor survived and your child survived she was only one year old when you left her and that was in  If she appeared before you right now as she now is shed be ten years old and if we went out to the Neighbor Star at the earliest practical moment she would be fifteen She wouldnt know you For that matter you wouldnt know her
	Ten years old or fifteen or fifty If I saw her Tessa I would know her said Fisher


Nineteen Remaining


	Marlene smiled hesitantly at Siever Genarr She had grown used to invading his office at will
	Am I interrupting you at a busy time Uncle Siever
	No dear this is not really a busy job It was devised so that Pitt could get rid of me and I took it and kept it so that I could be rid of Pitt Its not something I would admit to everyone but Im compelled to tell you the truth since you always spot the lie
	Does that frighten you Uncle Siever It frightened Commissioner Pitt and it would have frightened Aurinelif I had ever let him see what I could do
	It doesnt frighten me Marlene because Ive given up you see Ive just made up my mind that Im made of glass as far as youre concerned Actually its restful Lying is hard work when you stop to think about it If people were really lazy theyd never lie
	Marlene smiled again Is that why you like me Because I make it possible for you to be lazy
	Cant you tell
	No I can tell you like me but I cant tell why you like me The way you hold yourself shows you like me but the reason is hidden inside your mind and all I can get about that are vague feelings sometimes I cant quite reach in there She thought for a while Sometimes I wish I could
	Be glad you cant Minds are dirty dank uncomfortable places
	Why do you say that Uncle Siever
	Experience I dont have your natural ability but Ive been around people for much longer than you have Do you like the inside of your own mind Marlene
	Marlene looked surprised I dont know Why shouldnt I
	Do you like everything you think Everything you imagine Every impulse you have Be honest now Even though I cant read you be honest
	Well sometimes I think silly things or mean things Sometimes I get angry and think of doing things I wouldnt really do But not often really
	Not often Dont forget that youre used to your own mind You hardly sense it Its like the clothes you wear You dont feel the touch of them because youre so used to their being there Your hair curls down the back of your neck but you dont notice If someone elses hair touched the back of your neck it would itch and be unbearable Someone elses mind might think thoughts no worse than yours but they would be someone elses thoughts and you wouldnt like them For instance you might not like my liking youif you knew why I liked you It is much better and more peaceful to accept my liking you as something that exists and not scour my mind for reasons
	And inevitably Marlene said Why What are the reasons
	Well I like you because once I was you
	What do you mean
	I dont mean I was a young lady with beautiful eyes and the gift of perception I mean that I was young and thought I was plain and that everyone disliked me for being plain And I knew I was intelligent and I couldnt understand why everyone didnt like me for being intelligent It seemed unfair to be scorned for a bad property while a good property was ignored
	I was hurt and angry Marlene and made up my mind that I would never treat others as people treated me but I havent had much chance to put that good resolution into practice Then I met you and you come close Youre not as plain as I was by far and youre much more intelligent than I ever was but I dont mind your being better than me He smiled very broadly Its like giving myself a second chancewith advantages But come I dont think that is what you came to talk to me about I may not be perceptive in your sense but I can tell that much
	Well its my mother
	Oh Genarr frowned with a sudden obvious and almost painful increase in interest What about her
	Shes just about finished her project here you know If she goes back to Rotor shell want me to go back with her Must I
	I think so Dont you want to
	No I dont Uncle Siever I feel its important that I stay here So what I would like you to do is to tell Commissioner Pitt that you would like to keep us here You can make up an excuse that sounds good And the Commissioner Im pretty sure will be quite glad to have us stay especially if you explain that Mother has found out that Nemesis will destroy Earth
	Has she told you that Marlene
	No she didnt but she didnt have to You can explain to the Commissioner that Mother will probably annoy him continually with her insistence that the Solar System be warned
	Has it occurred to you that Pitt would not be keen on obliging me If he gets the idea I want to keep Eugenia and you here in the Erythro Dome hes liable to order you back to Rotor just to annoy me
	Im quite sure said Marlene calmly that the Commissioner would much rather please himself by keeping us here than displease you by taking us back Besides you want Mother here because youre youre fond of her
	Very fond of her All my life it seems But your mothers not fond of me You told me quite a while ago that your father still occupies her thoughts
	She likes you more and more Uncle Siever She likes you a great deal
	Liking is not loving Marlene Im sure youve already discovered that
	Marlene reddened Im talking about old people
	Like me and Genarr leaned his head back and laughed Then he said Im sorry Marlene Its just that old people always think young people havent really learned about love and young people think that old people have forgotten about love and you know theyre both wrong And why do you think its important to stay in the Erythro Dome Marlene Surely not just because you like me
	Of course I like you said Marlene seriously Very much But I want to stay here because I like Erythro
	Ive explained that its a dangerous world
	Not for me
	Youre still certain that the Plague wont affect you
	Of course it wont
	But how do you know
	I just know  Ive always known this even when I was on Rotor I had no reason not to
	No you didnt But after you were told about the Plague
	That didnt change things I feel completely safe here Even more than on Rotor
	Genarr shook his head slowly I must admit that I dont understand this He studied her solemn face her dark eyes halfhidden by those magnificent lashes However let me read your body language Marleneif I can You mean to have your own way in this at whatever cost and to remain on Erythro
	Yes said Marlene flatly And I expect you to help me
	Eugenia Insigna blazed quietly with anger Her voice was not loud but it was intense He cant do this Siever
	Of course he can Eugenia said Genarr just as quietly Hes the Commissioner
	But hes not an absolute ruler I have my citizens rights and one of them is freedom of movement
	If the Commissioner wishes to establish a state of emergency either general or for that matter confined to one person then citizens rights are suspended Thats more or less the gist of what the Enabling Act of  says
	But it makes a mockery of all the laws and traditions we have dating back to Rotors establishment
	I agree
	And if I make an outcry over this Pitt will find himself
	Eugenia please Listen to me Let it go For now why dont you and Marlene simply stay here Youre more than welcome
	What are you saying This amounts to imprisonment without accusation without trial without judgment We are compelled to stay in Erythro indefinitely by the arbitrary ukase
	Please do it without objection It will be better
	How better Insigna spoke with infinite contempt
	Because Marlene your daughter is very anxious that you do so Insigna looked blank Marlene
	Last week she came to me full of suggestions that I maneuver the Commissioner into ordering the two of you to remain here on Erythro
	Insigna halfrose from her seat wildly indignant  And you actually did it
	Genarr shook his head vigorously No Now listen to me All I did was to inform Pitt that your work here was finished and that I was uncertain whether it was his intention to have you return to Rotor with Marlene or to stay here It was a perfectly neutral statement Eugenia I showed it to Marlene before I sent it off and she was satisfied She said and I quote If you give him the choice he will keep us here And apparently hes doing that
	Insigna sank back Siever are you really following the advice of a fifteenyearold girl
	I dont think of Marlene as merely a fifteenyearold girl But tell me why are you so anxious to go back to Rotor
	My work
	There is none There will be none if Pitt doesnt want you Even assuming he allows you to return youd find yourself replaced Here on the other hand youll find equipment you can usethat you have used You came here after all to do what could not be done on Rotor
	My work doesnt matter cried out Insigna with sweeping inconsistency Dont you see that I want to return for the same reason that he wants me to stay He wants Marlene destroyed If I had known before I left of this Erythro Plague wed never have come I cant risk Marlenes mind
	Her mind is the last thing Id want to risk said Genarr I would sooner risk myself
	But it is at risk if we stay here
	Marlene doesnt think so
	Marlene Marlene You seem to think shes a goddess What does she know
	Listen to me Eugenia Lets talk about this rationally If it really seemed that Marlene was in danger I would get you both back to Rotor somehow but listen to me first Theres nothing megalomaniacal about Marlene is there
	Insigna was trembling Her passion had not receded I dont know what you mean
	Is she prone to making grandiose claims that are fanciful that are patently ridiculous
	Of course not Shes a very sensibleWhy do you ask these questions You know that she makes no claims that arent
	That arent substantiated I know She never boasted about her perceptivity It was more or less forced out of her by circumstance
	Yes but what is the purpose of all this Genarr kept on quietly Has she ever laid claim to having strange intuitive powers Has she ever expressed herself as certain that something some particular something was sure to happen or was sure not to happen for no reason other than that she was certain
	No of course not She clings to evidence She doesnt make wild claims without evidence
	Yet in one respect perhaps only in one respect she does She is certain that the Plague cannot touch her She claims that she experienced this utter confidence this certainty that Erythro cannot harm her even on Rotor and that it grew stronger when she reached the Dome She is quite determinedcompletely determinedto remain here
	Insignas eyes widened and her hand flew to her mouth She made an inarticulate sound and then said In that case and remained staring at him
	Yes Genarr said in sudden alarm Dont you see it Isnt this the Plague striking Her personality is changing Her mind is being affected
	Genarr sat frozen at the thought for a moment then he said No it cant be In all the cases of Plague nothing like this has been detected This is not the Plague
	Her mind is different from those of others It would be affected differently 
	No said Genarr desperately I cant believe that I wont believe that I believe that if Marlene says she is certain she is immune that she is immune and that her immunity will help us solve the puzzle of the Plague
	Insignas face whitened Is that why you want her here on Erythro Siever To use her as a tool against the Plague
	No I dont want her here only to use her Nevertheless she wants to stay and she may be a tool quite apart from whether we want her to be one or not
	And just because she wants to remain on Erythro you are willing to allow her to do so Just because she wants to stay out of some perverse desire she cant explain and in which you and I can see no reason or logic You seriously think she should be allowed to remain here merely because she wishes to Do you dare tell me that
	Genarr said with an effort  As a matter of fact I am tempted in that direction
	It is easy for you to be tempted She is not your child She is my child She is the only
	I know  said Genarr She is the only thing you have left ofCrile Dont stare at me like that I know that you have never overcome your loss I understand how you feel He said this last softly gently and looked as if he wanted to reach out and touch Insignas bowed head
	Just the same Eugenia if Marlene really wants to explore Erythro I think nothing will stop her from doing so in the end And if she is absolutely convinced that the Plague will not touch her mind perhaps that mental attitude will prevent it from doing so Marlenes aggressive sanity and confidence may be her mental immune mechanism
	Insigna snapped her head up her eyes smoldering You are speaking nonsense and you have no right to give in to this sudden streak of romanticism in a mere child She is a stranger to you You do not love her
	She is no stranger to me and I do love her More important I admire her Love would not give me that depth of confidence that would permit the risk but admiration would Think about it
	And they sat there staring at each other


Twenty Proof


	Kattimoro Tanayama with his accustomed tenacity lived out the year he had been allotted and was well into another year before his long battle was over When the time came he left the field of battle without a word or sign so that the instruments recorded death before any onlooker could see it had come
	It made little stir on Earth and none at all in the Settlements for the Old Man had always done his work outside the public eye and had been all the stronger for it It was those who dealt with him who knew his power and those who most depended on his strength and policy who were the most relieved to see him go
	The news reached Tessa Wendel early by the special channel set up between her headquarters and World City Somehow the fact that it had been expected for months did not ease the shock
	What would happen now Who would succeed Tanayama and what changes would be made She had been speculating on the matter for a long time but it was only now that the questions seemed to have real meaning Obviously despite everything Wendel and perhaps all who were involved had not really expected the Old Man to die
	She turned for comfort to Crile Fisher Wendel was realistic enough to know that it was not her now clearly middleaged body in less than two months she would be reaching an incredible fifty that held Fisher He was fortythree now and the bloom of youth had become somewhat overblown there too but it wasnt as obvious in a man In any case he was held and she could still make herself feel that it was she who held him figuratively especially on those occasions when she held him literally
	She said to Fisher Well now what Fisher said Its no surprise Tessa It should have happened before this
	Granted but its happened now It was his blind determination that kept this project going Now what
	Fisher said As long as he was alive you were eager for him to die Now you are concerned But I dont think you need worry The project will continue Something this size has a life of its own and it cant be stopped
	Have you ever tried to calculate how much this has cost Crile Therell be a new Director of the Terrestrial Board of Inquiry and the Global Congress will certainly pick someone they can control Therell be no new Tanayama before whom they must all cowernot in the foreseeable future And then theyll look at their budget and without Tanayamas gnarled hand covering it they will see it is meters deep in red ink and theyll want to cut it back
	How can they Theyve spent so much already Are they to stop with nothing to show for it That would really be a fiasco
	They can blame it on Tanayama He was a madman theyll say an egomaniac driven by an obsessionall of which is true to a considerable extent as we both knowand now they who were not responsible for any of this can return Earth to sanity and abandon something the planet cant really afford
	Fisher smiled Tessa my love your penetration of the manner of political thinking is probably par for a firstclass hyperspatialist genius The Director of the Office isin theory and in public perceptionan appointed official of narrow powers who is supposedly under the thorough control of the PresidentGeneral and the Global Congress These supposedly powerful officials who are elected cannot make it plain that Tanayama ruled them all and had them cowering in corners afraid to let their hearts beat without his permission They would reveal themselves to be cowards and incapable weaklings and they would risk losing their positions at the next election They will have to continue the project They will make cosmetic cuts only
	How can you be so sure muttered Wendel
	Long experience at watching elected officialdom Tessa Besides if we stop short were just inviting all the Settlements to get it before we doto move out into deep space and leave us behind the way Rotor did
	Oh How will they do that
	Given their knowledge of hyperassistance wouldnt you say that an advance to superluminal flight is inevitable
	Wendel looked at Fisher sardonically Crile my love your penetration of hyperspatialism is probably par for a firstclass wheedler of secrets Is that what you think of my work That it is an inevitable consequence of hyperassistance Havent you grasped the fact that hyperassistance is a natural consequence of relativistic thinking It still doesnt allow travel faster than the speed of light To move on to superluminal velocities requires a true leap in both thought and practice It would not come naturally and I have explained this to various people in the government They complained about the slowness and the expense and I had to explain the difficulties Theyll remember this now and they wont be afraid to stop us at this point I cant whip them onward by suddenly telling them that we may be outraced
	Fisher shook his head Of course you can tell them that And theyll believe you too because it will be true We can be easily overtaken
	Havent you listened to what Ive said
	I have but youre leaving something out Allow a little for common sense especially from someone youve just called a firstclass wheedler of secrets
	What are you talking about Crile
	This vast leap from hyperassistance to superluminal flight is only a vast leap if one begins at the beginning as you did The Settlements however are not beginning at the beginning Do you really think they know nothing at all about our project about Hyper City Do you think that I and my Earthly colleagues are the only wheedlers of secrets in the Solar System The Settlers have their wheedlers who work just as hard as we do and just as effectively For one thing theyve known you were on Earth almost from the day you arrived here 
	What if they knew
	Just this Do you think they dont have computers that will tell them you have written and published papers in the field Do you think they dont have access to those papers Do you think they havent read them painstakingly and carefully and that they havent found out you think that superluminal speeds are theoretically possible
	Wendel bit her lip and said Well
	Yes think about it When you wrote your thoughts on superluminal velocity you were merely speculating You were virtually a minority of one in thinking it might be possible No one took it seriously But now you come to Earth and you stay there You suddenly drop from sight and do not return to Adelia They may not know all the details of what youre doing for security on this project has been as tight as Tanayamas paranoia could make it Still the mere fact that youve disappeared is suggestive and there cant be any possible doubt in the light of what youve published as to what youre working on
	Something like Hyper City cant be kept a total secret The incredible sums of money being invested must leave a noticeable trace So every Settlement is scrabbling for odds and ends they may be able to convert into bits of knowledge And every bit gives them hints that will enable them to progress much more quickly than you were able to You tell them all that Tessa if any question arises over ending the project We can and will be overtaken in the race if we stop running That thought will keep the new people as firedup over the matter as ever Tanayama was and it all has the merit of being true
	Wendel was silent for a considerable time while Fisher watched her carefully
	Youre right my dear wheedler of secrets she said at last I made a mistake in thoughtlessly considering you a lover rather than an adviser
	Why should the two necessarily be mutually exclusive asked Fisher
	Although said Wendel I know very well that you have your own motivations in this
	What does that matter said Fisher even if its true provided mine run parallel with yours
	A delegation of Congressmen eventually arrived along with Igor Koropatsky the new Director of the Terrestrial Board of Inquiry He had been in subordinate positions at the Office for years so he was not completely unknown to Tessa Wendel
	He was a quiet man with smooth thinning gray hair a rather bulbous nose a comfortable double chin who looked wellfed and goodnatured He was shrewd undoubtedly but he obviously lacked Tanayamas almost diseased intensity At a full kilometer you could see that
	Congressmen were with him of course as though to show that this successor was their property and under their control They must surely be hoping it would stay that way Tanayama had been a long and bitter lesson
	No one suggested that the project be ended Rather the concern was that it be hastenedif possible Wendels cautious attempt to stress the possibility that the Settlements might overtake Earth or be hot on its heels was accepted without demur almost dismissed as obvious on the face of it
	Koropatsky who was allowed to be spokesman and to take the responsibility said Dr Wendel I do not ask for a long formal tour of Hyper City I have been here before and it is more important that I spend some time reorganizing the Office I mean no disrespect to my distinguished predecessor but any shifting of an important administrative body from one person to another requires a great deal of reorganization especially if the predecessors tenure has been a lengthy one N ow I am not by nature a formal man Let us therefore speak freely and informally and I will ask some questions which I hope you will answer in a way that a man of my own modest attainments in science will have no trouble in understanding
	Wendel nodded I will do my best Director
	Good When do you expect to have a superluminal starship in operation
	You must realize Director that this is an essentially unanswerable question We are at the mercy of unforeseen difficulties and accidents
	Assume only reasonable difficulties and no accidents
	In that case since we have completed the science and need only the engineering if we are fortunate we will have a ship in three years perhaps
	You will be ready in  in other words
	Certainly not sooner
	How many persons will it carry
	Five to seven perhaps
	How far will it go
	As far as we wish Director That is the beauty of superluminal velocity Because we are passing through hyperspace where the ordinary laws of physics do not apply not even the conservation of energy it costs no more effort to go a thousand lightyears than to go one
	The Director stirred uneasily I am not a physicist but I find it difficult to accept an environment without constraints Are there not things you cannot do
	There are constraints We need a vacuum and a gravitational intensity below a certain point if we are to make the transition into and out of hyperspace We will with experience undoubtedly find additional restraints which might have to be determined through test flights The results might necessitate further delays
	Once you have the ship where will the first flight take you
	It might seem prudent to allow the first trip to go no farther than the planet Pluto for instance but that might well be considered an unbearable waste of time Once we have the technology with which to visit the stars the temptation to actually visit one would be overwhelming
	Such as the Neighbor Star
	That would the logical goal ExDirector Tanayama wanted that visited but I must point out that there are other stars far more interesting Sirius is only four times as far away and it would give us a chance to observe a white dwarf star at close range
	Dr Wendel I think that the Neighbor Star must be the goal though not necessarily for Tanayamas reasons Suppose you travel far out to some other starany other starand return How would you prove that you had indeed been in the neighborhood of another star
	Wendel looked startled Prove I dont understand you
	I mean how would you counter accusations that the supposed flight was actually a fake
	A fake Wendel rose furiously to her feet That is insulting Koropatskys voice suddenly grew dominating Sit down Dr
	Wendel You are being accused of nothing I am trying to foresee a situation and to guard against it Humanity moved into space almost three centuries ago It is a notaltogetherforgotten episode in history and my subdivision of the globe remembers it particularly well When the first satellites went up in those dim days of terrestrial confinement there were those who insisted everything presented by those satellites were fakes The first photographs of the far side of the Moon were accused of having been faked Even the first pictures of Earth from space were called fakes by some few who believed the Earth was flat Now if Earth claims to have superluminal flight we may run into similar trouble
	Why Director Why should anyone think we would lie about a thing like that
	My dear Dr Wendel you are naive For over three centuries Albert Einstein has been the demigod who invented cosmology People for generation after generation have grown used to the concept of the speed of light as an absolute limit They will not readily give it up Even the principle of causalityand one cant think of anything more basic than that cause must precede effectseems violated Thats one thing
	Another Dr Wendel is that the Settlements might find it politically useful to convince their peoples and Earthmen too that we are lying It will confuse us involve us in polemics waste our time and give them more of a chance to catch up So I ask you Is there a simple proof that any flight you might make would be a truly legitimate one
	Wendel said icily Director we would permit scientists to inspect our ship once we return We will undertake to explain the techniques used
	No no no Please Dont go any further That would only convince scientists as knowledgeable as yourself
	Well then when we come back we will have photographs of the sky and the nearer stars will be positioned slightly differently with respect to each other From the change in relative positions it will be possible to calculate exactly where we were relative to the Sun
	Also just for scientists Completely unconvincing to the average person
	Well have closeup pictures of whatever star we visit It will be quite different from our Sun in every respect
	But this sort of thing is done in every trivial holovision program dealing with interstellar travel It is the small change of the science fiction epic It would be no more than a Captain Galaxy program
	In that case said Wendel with teethclenching exasperation I dont know of any way If people will not believe then they will not believe It is a problem you must handle I am only a scientist
	Now now Doctor Keep your temper please When Columbus returned from his first trip across the ocean seven and a half centuries ago no one accused him of fakery Why Because he brought back with him native people from the new shores he had visited
	Very good but the chance of finding lifebearing worlds and bringing back specimens is very small
	Perhaps not Rotor you know is believed to have discovered the Neighbor Star with their Far Probe and to have left the Solar System soon after that Since they never returned it is possible that they traveled to the Neighbor Star and remained there and in fact are still there
	So Director Tanayama believed However the trip with hyperassistance would have taken over two years It may be that through accident through scientific failure through psychological problems they never completed the trip That too would account for their never returning
	Nevertheless said Koropatsky quietly insistent they may have arrived
	Even if they have arrived they are likely to have simply gone into orbit around the star in the certain absence of any habitable world In isolation the psychological strains which didnt stop them en route would stop them then and it is likely there is now only a dead Settlement whirling the Neighbor Star forever
	Then you now see that it must be the goal because once youre there you will seek out Rotor alive or dead Either way you must bring back something unmistakably Rotorian and it would then be very easy for everyone to believe that you had indeed gone out to the stars and come back He smiled broadly Even I would believe it and that would answer my question as to how you would prove that you had made a superluminal trip That will be your mission then and for that never fear Earth will continue to find you the money and resources and workers you will need
	And when after a dinner during which technical points were not raised Koropatsky said to Wendel in the friendliest possible tone but with more than a hint of ice beneath Just the same remember that you have only three years to do it in At the most 
	So my clever ploy wasnt really needed said Crile Fisher with a slight air of regret
	No They were determined to continue without the threat of being overtaken The only thing that bothered them and it was something that never seemed to bother Tanayama was this matter of having to battle possible cases of fakery I suppose Tanayama just wanted to destroy Rotor As long as that was done the world could yell Fake all it wanted
	They wouldnt He would have had the ship bring back something to show him that Rotor was destroyed That would prove it to the world too What kind of fellow is the new Director
	Quite the reverse of Tanayama He seems soft almost apologetic but I have a feeling that the Global Congress is going to find him just as hard to handle as Tanayama was He has to settle into his job thats all
	From what youve told me about the conversation he seems more sensible than Tanayama
	Yes but it still steams methat suggestion of fakery Imagine thinking spaceflights would be faked Its probably the result of Earthmen having no feel for space No feel at all Its you people having this endless world and except in a microscopic fraction of cases never leaving it
	Fisher smiled Well Im one of the microscopic fraction that has left it Often And youre a Settler So neither one of us is planetbound
	Thats right said Wendel shooting him a sidelong glance Sometimes I think you dont remember that Im a Settler
	Believe me I never forget it I dont go about muttering to myself Tessa is a Settler Tessa is a Settler but at all times I know you are
	Does anyone else though She waved her hand around as though to include an indefinite surrounding volume Here is Hyper City under unimaginably tight security and why Against the Settlers The whole point is to get out there with practical superluminal flight before the Settlers can even get started And who is in complete charge of the project A Settler
	Is this the first time youve thought of that in the five years youve been on the project
	No but I think of it periodically I just dont understand it Arent they afraid to trust me
	Fisher laughed Not really Youre a scientist
	So
	So scientists are considered mercenaries without ties to anyone society Give a scientist a fascinating problem and all the money equipment and help that he or she needs to tackle that problem and that scientist wouldnt care who the source of support was Be truthfulYou care neither for Earth nor Adelia nor for the Settlements as a whole nor even for humanity as a whole You just want to work out the details of superluminal flight and you have no loyalties beyond that
	Wendel said haughtily Thats a stereotype and not every scientist will fit it I may not fit it
	Im sure they realize that too so that you are probably under constant surveillance Tessa Some of your closest associates probably have as an important aspect of their work the constant monitoring of your activities and the constant reporting to the government
	Youre not referring to yourself I hope
	Dont tell me youve never thought that I might be remaining near you entirely in my role as wheedler of secrets
	As a matter of fact the idea has occurred to menow and then
	But its not my job I suspect that Im too close to you to be trusted In fact Im quite sure that Im reported on too and that my activity is carefully weighed As long as I keep you happy
	Youre a coldblooded person Crile How can you find humor in something like that
	Theres no humor there Im trying to be realistic If you ever tire of me I lose my function An unhappy Tessa may be an unproductive Tessa so I will be suddenly gotten out of your hair and the way will be smoothed for my successor After all your contentment is worth far more to them than mine is and I recognize that it is only sensible that that be the case You see my realism
	Whereupon Wendel reached out suddenly to stroke Criles cheek Dont worry I think Ive grown too used to you to tire of you now In the hot blood of my youth I could grow bored with my men and discard them but now
	Its too much of an effort eh
	If you choose to think of it that way I might also finally be in lovein my way
	I understand your meaning Love in cool blood can be restful But I suspect this is not the proper moment to prove it Youll have to chew over this exchange with Koropatsky first and get that poisonous feeling about fakery out of your system
	Ill get over that someday But theres another thing I told you a little while ago about Earthpeople having no feel for space
	Yes I remember
	Well heres an example Koropatsky has no feelingno feeling at allfor the sheer size of space He talked about going to the Neighbor Star and finding Rotor Now how is that to be done Every once in a while we spot an asteroid and lose it before we can calculate its orbit Do you know how long it takes to relocate that lost asteroid even with all our modern devices and instruments Years sometimes Space is large even in the near vicinity of a star and Rotor is small
	Yes but we search for one asteroid among a hundred thousand Rotor on the other hand will be the only object of its kind near the Neighbor Star
	Who told you that Even if the Neighbor Star doesnt have a planetary system in our sense it is extremely unlikely that it wont be surrounded by debris of one sort or another
	But it would be dead debris like our dead asteroids Since Rotor will be a functioning Settlement it will be emitting a wide range of radiation and that should be easy to detect
	If Rotor is a functioning Settlement What if it isnt Then its just another asteroid and finding it may prove an enormous task We may not succeed at all in any reasonable period of time
	Fisher could not keep his face from falling into lines of misery Wendel made a small sound and moved closer to him placing an arm around his unresponsive shoulder Oh my dear you know the situation You must face it
	Fisher said in a choked voice I know But they may have survived Isnt that true
	They may said Wendel with a slightly synthetic lilt to her voice and if they have so much the better for us As you pointed out it would then be easy to locate them through their radiational output And more than that
	Yes
	Koropatsky wants us to bring back something that will prove we encountered Rotor feeling that would be the best evidence that we had indeed been in deep space and returned covering several lightyears in at most a few months ExceptWhat exactly could we bring back that would be convincing Suppose we find some drifting bits of metal or concrete Not any bit will do A lump of metal with nothing to identify it as Rotorian would be something we might well have taken with us Even if we manage to find a piece that is characteristic of Rotorsome artifact that could only exist on a Settlementit might be considered a fake
	If however Rotor were a working living Settlement we might be able to persuade some Rotorian to come back with us A Rotorian can be identified as one Fingerprints retinal patterns DNA analysis There may even be people on other Settlements or on Earth who would be able to recognize the particular Rotorian we bring back Koropatsky hinted heavily that we do this He pointed out that Columbus returning from his first voyage brought Native Americans with him
	Of courseand Wendel sighed heavily as she went onthere is a limit to how much we can bring back animate or inanimate Someday we may have stars hips as large as Settlements but our first one is going to be a small and by later standards a primitive thing Im sure We might be able to bring back one Rotorian more than one would be more than we could handle so well have to pick the right one
	My daughter Marlene said Fisher She might not want to come We can only take someone whos willing to return Theres bound to be one among the thousands perhaps even a large number but if she doesnt want to come
	Marlene will be willing to come You let me talk to her Somehow Ill win her over 
	Her mother might not wish it
	Somehow Ill talk her into it said Fisher stubbornly Somehow Ill manage
	Wendel sighed again I cant let you live with that thought Crile
	Dont you see that we cant take your daughter back even if she is willing to come
	Why not Why not
	She was one year old when she left She has no memories of the Solar System No one in the Solar System could identify her There are very unlikely to have been any records that could be checked independently elsewhere in the system No we would have to have some middleaged person at the least and one who has visited other Settlements or better yet Earth
	She paused and then said tightly Your wife might be suitable Didnt you once tell me that she took part of her education on Earth There would be records and she would be identifiable Though to be honest I would much rather take someone else
	Fisher was silent Wendel said almost timidly Im sorry Crile Its not as I would wish it
	And Fisher said bitterly Just let my Marlene be alive Well see what can be done


TwentyOne Brainscan


	Im sorry said Siever Genarr looking down his long nose at mother and daughter with an expression that seemed to beg their pardon even without his words I had told Marlene that this job was not a very busy one and then almost immediately thereafter we had a kind of minicrisis with our power supply and I found I had to delay this conference of ours The crisis is over however and wasnt much to begin with now that we can view it in hindsight Am I forgiven
	Of course Siever said Eugenia Insigna She was clearly restless I wont say its been an easy three days though I feel that every hour we stay here increases Marlenes danger
	Marlene said I dont fear Erythro at all Uncle Siever Insigna said  And I dont think Pitt can do anything against us on Rotor He knows that or he wouldnt have sent us here
	Genarr said  And I will try to play the honest broker and satisfy you both Whatever Pitt can or cannot do openly there is a great deal he can do indirectly so its dangerous Eugenia for you to let your fear of Erythro lead you to underestimate Pitts resolve and ingenuity To begin with if you return to Rotor you will be doing so against his emergency ruling and he can imprison you or send you into exile on New Rotor or even send you back here
	As for Erythro we dont dare underestimate the danger of the Plague either even though it seems to have died out in its virulent early form I am as reluctant to risk Marlene as you are Eugenia
	And Marlene whispered in exasperation Theres no risk
	Insigna said Siever I dont think we should carryon this discussion of Marlene in her presence
	Youre wrong I want to do it in her presence I suspect that she knows better than either of us what she ought to do She is the caretaker of that mind of hers and it is our job to interfere with her as little as possible
	Insigna made an inarticulate sound in her throat but Genarr went on a quality of remorselessness entering his voice I want her in this discussion because I want her input I want her opinion
	Insigna said But you know her opinion She wants to go out there and youre saying that we must let her do what she wants to do because she is somehow magical
	No one said a word about magical or about simply letting her go out I would like to suggest we experiment with all due precautions
	In what way
	To begin with I would like a brain scan He turned to Marlene Do you understand Marlene that thats necessary Do you have any objections
	Marlene frowned slightly Ive had brain scans Everyone has had brain scans They dont let you start school without a brain scan Any time you have a complete medical examination
	I know said Genarr gently I havent completely wasted these last three days I have hereand his hand came to rest on a stack of computer strips at the left end of his deskthe computerization of every single brain scan youve ever had
	But youre not telling everything Uncle Siever said Marlene calmly
	Ah said Insigna with a touch of triumph What is he hiding Marlene
	Hes a little nervous about me He doesnt entirely believe my feeling that Im safe Hes uncertain
	Genarr said How can that be Marlene I feel quite certain about your safety
	But Marlene said with a glow of sudden enlightenment I think thats why you waited three days Uncle Siever You argued yourself into being certain so that I wouldnt see your uncertainty But it didnt work I can still see it
	Genarr said If that shows Marlene then its only because I value you so highly that I find even the slightest risk unpleasant
	Insigna said angrily If you find even the slightest risk unpleasant how do you suppose I feel as a mother So in your uncertainty you obtain brain scans violating Marlenes medical privacy
	I had to find out And I did Theyre insufficient
	Insufficient in what way
	In the early days of the Dome when the Plague struck again and again one of our concerns was to devise a more detailed brain scanner and a more efficiently programmed computer to interpret the data This has never been transferred to Rotor Pitts exaggerated desire to hide the Plague led him to resist the sudden appearance of an improved brain scanner on Rotor It might have given rise to inconvenient questions and rumors Ridiculous to my way of thinking but in this as in many other things Pitt had his way Therefore Marlene you have never been properly brain scanned and I want you to have one on our device
	Marlene shrank back No A look of hope crossed Insignas face Why not Marlene
	Because when Uncle Siever said thathe was suddenly much more uncertain
	Genarr said No thats not He stopped himself lifted his arms and let them drop helplessly Why do I bother Marlene dear if I seemed suddenly concerned its because we need as detailed a brain scan as possible to serve as a standard of mental normality Then if you are exposed to Erythro and suffer even the slightest mental distortion as a result it can be detected by brain scan even when no one can tell by simply looking at you or talking to you Well as soon as I mention a detailed brain scan I think of the possibility of detecting an otherwise indetectable mental changeand the thought itself sparks an automatic concern That s what you detect Come Marlene how much uncertainty do you detect Be quantitative
	But Marlene said Not much but its there The trouble is I can only tell youre uncertain I cant tell why Maybe this special brain scan is dangerous
	How can it be It has been used SoMarlene you know Erythro wont hurt you Dont you also know that the brain scan wont hurt you
	No I dont
	Do you know that it wilt hurt you A pause and then Marlene said reluctantly No
	But how can you be sure about Erythro and not sure about the brain scan
	I dont know I just know that Erythro wont hurt me but I dont know that the brain scan wont Or will
	A smile crossed Genarrs face It did not take unusual abilities to see that he was enormously relieved
	Marlene said Why does that make you feel good Uncle Siever Genarr said Because if you were making up your intuitional feelingsout of a desire to be important or out of general romanticism or out of some sort of selfdelusionyou would apply it to everything But you dont You pick and choose Some things you know and some things you dont know That makes me far more inclined to believe you when you claim to be sure Erythro wont hurt you and I no longer in the least fear that the brain scan will reveal anything disturbing
	Marlene turned to her mother Hes right Mother He feels much better and so I feel much better Its so obvious Cant you see it too
	It doesnt matter what I see said Insigna I dont feel better
	Oh Mother murmured Marlene Then more loudly to Genarr Ill take the scan
	This is not surprising murmured Siever Genarr He was watching the computer graphics in their intricate almost floral patterns as they moved slowly in and out in false color Eugenia Insigna at his side stared at it keenly but understood nothing
	What is not surprising Siever she asked I cant tell you properly because I dont have their jargon down pat And if Ranay D Aubisson whos our local guru on this were to explain it neither you nor I would understand her However she did point this out to me 
	It looks like a snail shell
	The color makes it stand out Its a measure of complexity rather than a direct indication of physical form Ranay says This part is atypical We dont find it in brains generally
	Insignas lip trembled You mean shes already affected
	No of course not I said atypical not abnormal Surely I dont have to explain that to an experienced scientific observer Youll have to admit that Marlene is different In a way Im glad that the snail shell is there If her brain were completely typical wed have to wonder why she seems to be what she is where the perceptivity is coming from Is she cleverly faking it or are we fools
	But how do you know it isnt somethingsomething
	Diseased How can that be We have all of the brain scans collected over her lifetime from infancy That atypicality was always there
	It was never reported to me No one ever remarked on it
	Of course not Those early brain scans were the usual fairly primitive type and it wouldnt show at least not so that it would hit you in the face But once we have this proper brain scan and can see the detail clearly we can go back to the early ones and make it out Ranay has already done so I tell you Eugenia this advanced brain scanning technique ought to be standard on Rotor Pitts suppression of it is one of his most foolish moves Its expensive of course
	Ill pay murmured Insigna
	Dont be silly Im putting this one on the Dome budget After all this may be helpful in solving the Plague mystery At least thats what Ill claim if its ever questioned Well there you are Marlenes brain is recorded in greater complexity than ever before If she should be even slightly affected it will show on the screen
	You have no idea how frightening this is said Insigna
	I dont blame you you know But she is so confident that I cant help going along with her Im convinced that this solid sense of security has meaning behind it
	How can it
	Genarr pointed to the snail shell You dont have that and I dont have it so neither of us is in a position to tell where and how she gets her sense of security But she has it so we must let her out on the surface 
	Why must we risk her Can you possibly explain to me why we must risk her
	Two reasons First she does seem determined and I have the feeling that shell get whatever shes determined to getsooner or later In that case we might as well be cheerful about it and send her off since we wont be able to stop her for very long Secondly its possible well learn something about the Plague as a result What that might be I cant say but anything however small that will yield additional information concerning the Plague is worth a great deal
	Not my daughters mind
	It wont come to that For one thing even though I have faith in Marlene and believe theres no risk I will do what I can to minimize it for your sake In the first place well not let her out onto the surface itself for a while I may take her out on a flight over Erythro for instance Shell see lakes and plains hills canyons We might even go as far as the edge of the sea It all has a stark beautyI saw it once but it is barren There is no life anywhere that she can seeonly the prokaryotes in the water which are invisible of course Its possible that the uniform barrenness may repel her and she may lose interest in the outside altogether
	If however she is still keen on going out on feeling the soil of Erythro under her feet we will see to it that she wears an Esuit
	What is an Esuit
	An Erythrosuit Its a straightforward affairlike a spacesuit except that it doesnt have to hold in air pressure against a vacuum Its an impermeable combination of plastic and textile thats very light and doesnt impede motion The helmet with its infrared shielding is somewhat more substantial and there is an artificial air supply and ventilation What it amounts to is that the person in an Esuit is not subjected to the Erythro environment And on top of that therell be someone with her
	Who I would trust no one with her but myself Genarr smiled I couldnt imagine a less suitable companion You know nothing about Erythro really and youre frightened of it I wouldnt dare let you out there Look the only person we can trust is not you but me
	You Insigna stared at him openmouthed Why not No one here knows Erythro better than I do and if Marlene is immune to the Plague so am I In ten years on Erythro I havent been affected in the slightest Whats more I can fly an aircraft which means we wont need a pilot And then too if I go out with Marlene I can watch her closely If she does anything abnormal no matter how slightly Ill have her back in the Dome and under the brain scan faster than light
	By which time of course it will be too late
	No Not necessarily You mustnt look upon the Plague as an allornothing matter There have been light cases even very light cases and people who are lightly affected can live reasonably normal lives Nothing will happen to her Im sure of it
	Insigna sat in her chair silent seeming somehow small and defenseless
	Genarr impulsively placed his arm around her Come Eugenia forget this for a week I promise shell not go out for at least a weeklonger than that if I can weaken her resolve by showing her Erythro from the air And during the flight she will be enclosed in the aircraft and will be as safe there as she is here As for right now Ill tell you whatyoure an astronomer arent you
	She looked at him and said wanly You know I am
	Then that means that you never look at the stars Astronomers never do They only look at their instruments Its night over the Dome now so lets go up to the observation deck and observe The night is absolutely clear and there is nothing like just looking at the stars to make one feel quiet and at peace Trust me
	It was true Astronomers did not look at the stars There was no need One gave instructions to the telescopes the cameras and the spectroscope by way of the computer which received instructions in the way of programming
	The instruments did the work the analyses the graphic simulations The astronomer merely asked the questions then studied the answers For that one didnt have to look at the stars
	But then she thought how does one look at stars idly Can one when one is an astronomer The mere sight should make one uneasy There was work to be done questions to be asked mysteries to be solved and after a while surely one would return to ones workshop and set some instruments in motion while one distracted ones mind by reading a novel or watching a holovision spectacle
	She muttered this to Siever Genarr as he went about his office checking loose ends before leaving He was a confirmed looseend checker Insigna remembered from the ancient days when they were all young It had irritated her then but perhaps she ought to have admired it Siever had so many virtues she thought and Crile on the other hand
	She dragged at her thoughts mercilessly and pointed them another way
	Genarr was saying  Actually I dont use the observation deck myself very often There always seems to be something else to do And when I do go I almost always find myself alone up there It will be pleasant to have company Come
	He led the way to a small elevator It was the first time Insigna had been in an elevator in the Dome and for a fleeting moment it was as though she were back on Rotorexcept that she felt no change in pseudogravitation pull and did not feel herself pressed gently against one of the walls through a Coriolis effect as she would have been on Rotor
	Here we are said Genarr and motioned to Insigna to step out She did so curiously into the empty chamber and almost at once shrank back She said  Are we exposed
	Exposed Genarr asked bewildered Oh you mean are we open to Erythros atmosphere No no Have no fears about that We are enclosed in a hemisphere of diamondcoated glass which nothing scratches A meteorite would smash it of course but the skies of Erythro are virtually meteorfree We have such glass on Rotor you know butand his voice took on a tone of pridenot quite this quality and not quite this size
	They treat you well down here said Insigna reaching out gently to touch the glass again and assure herself of its existence
	They must to get people to come here Then reverting to the bubble It rains of course on occasion but its cloudy then anyway And once the skies clear it dries up quickly A residue is left behind and during the day a special detergent mixture cleans the bubble Sit down Eugenia
	Insigna sat in a chair that was soft and comfortable and that reclined almost of its own accord so that she found herself looking upward She could hear another chair sigh softly as Genarrs weight pushed it backward And then the small nightlights which had cast a glow sufficient to point out the presence and location of chairs and small tables in the room went out In the darkness of an uninhabited world the sky cloudless and as dark as black velvet burned with sparks
	Insigna gasped She knew what the sky was like in theory She had seen it on charts and maps in simulations and photographsin every shape and way except reality She found herself not picking out the interesting objects the puzzling items the mysteries that demanded she get to work She didnt look at anyone object but at the patterns they made
	In dim prehistory she thought it was the study of the patterns and not of the stars themselves that gave the ancients the constellations and the beginning of astronomy
	Genarr was right Peace like a fine unfelt cobweb settled down over her
	After a while she said almost sleepily Thank you Genarr
	For what
	For offering to go out with Marlene For risking your mind for my daughter
	Im not risking my mind Nothing will happen to either of us Besides I have aa fatherly feeling toward her After all Eugenia we go a long way back together you and I and I thinkhave always thoughthighly of you
	I know said Insigna feeling the stirrings of guilt She had always known how Genarr had felthe could never obscure it It had inspired her with resignation before she met Crile and with annoyance afterward
	She said If Ive ever hurt your feelings Siever I am truly sorry
	No need said Genarr softly and there was a long silence while peace deepened and Insigna found herself earnestly hoping that no one would enter and break the strange spell of serenity that held her fast
	And then Genarr said I have a theory as to why people dont come up to the observation deck here Or on Rotor Did you ever notice that the observation deck isnt used much on Rotor either
	Marlene liked to go there on occasion said Insigna She told me she was usually alone up there In the last year or so she would tell me that she liked to watch Erythro I should have listened more closelypaid attention
	Marlene is unusual I think what gets most people and keeps them from coming up here is that
	What asked Insigna That said Genarr He was pointing to some spot in the sky but in the darkness she could not see his arm That very bright star the brightest in the sky
	You mean the Sunour Sunthe Sun of the Solar System
	Yes I do Its an interloper Except for that bright star the sky would be just about the same as the one we see from Earth Alpha Centauri is rather out of place and Sirius is shifted slightly but we wouldnt notice that Barring such things the sky you see is what the Sumerians saw five thousand years ago All except for the Sun
	And you think the Sun keeps people away from the observation deck
	Yes perhaps not consciously but I think the sight of it makes them uneasy The tendency is to think of the Sun as far far away unreachable part of an altogether different Universe Yet there it is in the sky bright demanding our attention stirring up our guilt for having run away from it
	But then why dont the teenagers and children go to the observation deck They know little or nothing of the Sun and the Solar System
	The rest of us set a negative example When were all gone when theres no one on Rotor to whom the Solar System is anything but a phrase I think the sky will seem to belong to Rotor again and this place will be crowdedif it still exists
	Do you think it wont still exist
	We cant foresee the future Eugenia
	We seem to be flourishing and growing so far
	Yes we are but its that bright starthe interloperthat Im worried about
	Our old Sun What can it do It cant reach us
	Sure it can Genarr was staring at the bright star in the western sky The people weve left behind on Earth and on the Settlements are bound to discover Nemesis eventually Maybe they already have And maybe theyve worked out hyperassistance Im of the opinion they must have developed hyperassistance soon after we left Our disappearance must have stimulated them greatly
	We left fourteen years ago Why arent they already here
	Perhaps they quail at the thought of a twoyear flight They know that Rotor attempted it but they dont know that we succeeded at it They may think that our wreckage is strewn through space all the way from the Sun to Nemesis
	We didnt lack the courage to attempt it
	Sure we did Do you think that Rotor would have made the attempt if we hadnt had Pitt It was Pitt who drove the rest of us and I doubt that theres another Pitt anywhere in the Settlements or on Earth for that matter You know I dont like Pitt I disapprove of his methods of his morals or the lack of them of his deviousness of his coldblooded ability to send a girl like Marlene to what he clearly hopes will be her destruction and yet if we go by results he may go down in history as a great man
	As a great leader said Insigna You are a great man Siever Theres a clear difference
	There was silence again till Genarr said softly I keep waiting for them to come here after us Thats my biggest fear and it seems to strengthen when the interloper shines down upon me Its fourteen years now since we left the Solar System What have they been doing in these fourteen years Have you ever wondered about that Eugenia
	Never said Insigna halfasleep My worries are more immediate


TwentyTwo Asteroid


	August   It meant something to Crile Fisher for it was Tessa Wendels birthday To be precise it was her fiftythird birthday She made no reference to the day or to its significanceperhaps because she had been so proud of her youthful appearance on Adelia or perhaps because she was overconscious of Fishers five years advantage
	But their relative age difference didnt matter to Crile Even if Fisher had not been attracted to her intelligence and to her sexual vigor Tessa held the key to Rotor and he knew it
	There were fine wrinkles around her eyes now and a distinct flabbiness to her upper arms but her unmentioned birthday was one of triumph for her and she came swinging into the apartment which had grown steadily more lavish with the years and threw herself into her sturdy fieldbottomed armchair with a smile of satisfaction on her face
	It went as smoothly as interstellar space Absolute perfection
	I wish I had been there said Crile I wish you had too Crile but were on a strictly needtoknow basis and I get you involved in more things than I should as it is
	The goal had been Hypermnestra an otherwise undistinguished asteroid that was in a convenient position not too close to other asteroids at the moment and what was more important not too close to Jupiter It was also unclaimed by any Settlement and unvisited by any And to top it off there were the first two syllables of the name which however trivial seemed to represent a proper target for a superluminal flight through hyperspace
	I take it you got the ship there safely
	Within ten thousand kilometers We could easily have placed it closer but we didnt want to risk an intensification of its gravitational field feeble though it was And back of course to the prearranged spot Its being shepherded in by two ordinary vessels
	I suppose the Settlements were on the lookout
	Of course but its one thing to see that the ship vanishes instantaneously and quite another to tell where it went whether it went at or near light speed or many multiples of it and most of all how it was done So what they do see means nothing
	They had nothing in the neighborhood of Hypermnestra did they
	They had no way of knowing what the destination was barring a breakdown of security and that apparently didnt happen If they had known or guessed that alone still would not have helped them All in all Crile very satisfactory 
	Obviously a giant step
	With additional giant steps still facing us It was the first ship capable of carrying a human being to attain superluminal velocity but as you know it was staffedif thats the wordby one robot
	Did the robot operate successfully
	Completely but thats not very significant except that it shows we can transfer a fairly large mass there and back in one pieceat least in one piece on the macroscale It will take several weeks of inspection to make sure that no dangerous damage was done on the microscale And of course that still leaves us the task of building larger ships of making sure that lifesupport systems are incorporated and functioning well and of multiplying safety provisions A robot can take stresses that human beings cannot
	And is the schedule holding up
	So far So far Another year or year and a halfif there are no disasters or unexpected accidentsand we ought to be able to surprise the Rotorians assuming them to exist
	Fisher winced and Wendel said looking hangdog Im sorry I keep promising myself not to say things like that but it does slip out once in a while
	Never mind said Fisher Is it definitely settled that Ill be going on the first trip to Rotor
	If anything can be definitely settled for something that wont take place for a year or more Theres no way of guarding against sudden shifts of needs
	But so far
	Apparently Tanayama had left behind a note to the effect that you were promised a berthmore decent of him than I would have expected Koropatsky was kind enough to tell me about the note today after the successful flight when it seemed to me that it might be a good time to advance the possibility
	Good Tanayama promised it to me by word of mouth once I am glad he put it on the record
	Do you mind telling me why he made that promise Tanayama always struck me as someone who gave nothing for nothing
	Youre right I got the trip on condition that I brought you back to Earth to work on superluminal velocities I think youll recall I carried out that task triumphantly
	Wendel snorted I doubt that it was that alone that shook and moved your government Koropatsky said that he would not consider himself bound by Tanayamas promises ordinarily but that you had lived on Rotor for some years and that your special knowledge might come in handy My own feeling is that your special knowledge after thirteen years might have dimmed but I didnt say that because I was feeling good after the trial and decided that for the moment I loved you
	Fisher smiled I feel relieved Tessa I hope youll be on the first flight too Did you get that straightened out
	Wendel pulled her head back an inch or two as though to get Fisher into better focus That was a lot harder my boy They were perfectly willing to send you into danger but as for me they said that I couldnt be spared Who could carryon the project if anything happens to you they said So I said Only anyone of about twenty of my subordinates who are as well up on superluminal flight as I am and whose minds are younger and nimbler A lie of course since theres no one quite like me but it impressed them
	Theres something to what they say you know Should you take the risk
	Yes said Wendel For one thing I want the credit of being captain of the first superluminal flight For another I am curious to see another star and resent that these Rotorians got there first if She caught herself and said  And finally and most important I believe I want to get off Earth She said that with a virtual snarl
	Afterward as they lay in bed together she said  And when the time comes and we finally get there what a marvelous feeling it will be
	Fisher did not answer He was thinking of a child with strange large eyes and of his sister and the two seemed to fuse as drowsiness closed down over him


TwentyThree Airflight


	Longdistance travel through a planetary atmosphere was not something that Settlers accepted as part of their society On a Settlement distances were small enough so that elevators legs and an occasional electric cart were all that was necessary As for interSettlement travel that was by rocket
	Many Settlersat least back in the Solar Systemhad been in space so many times that progress through it was almost as common to them as walking It was a rare Settler however who had traveled to Earth where alone atmospheric travel existed and which had made use of airflight
	Settlers who could face the vacuum as though it were a friend and brother felt unfathomable terror if expected to sense somehow the whistle of air past a vehicle without groundsupport below
	Yet air travel on occasion was an obvious necessity on Erythro Like Earth it was a large world and like Earth it had a fairly dense and breathable atmosphere There were reference books on airflight available on Rotor and even several Earth immigrants with aeronautical experience
	So the Dome owned two small aircraft somewhat clumsy somewhat primitive ungiven to large bursts of speed or to headlong maneuverabilitybut serviceable
	In fact Rotors very ignorance of aeronautical engineering helped in one respect The Domes aircraft were far more computerized than any corresponding vessel on Earth In fact Siever Genarr liked to think of the vessels as intricate robots that happened to be built in the shape of aircraft Erythros weather was much milder than Earths could possibly be since the low intensity of the radiation from Nemesis was insufficient to power large and violent storms so that an aircraftrobot was less likely to have to face an emergency Far less likely
	As a result virtually anyone could fly the raw and unpolished aircraft of the Dome You simply told the plane what you wanted it to do and it was done If the message was unclear or seemed dangerous to the robotic brain of the vessel it asked for clarification
	Genarr watched Marlene climb into the cabin of the plane with a certain natural concern if not with the lipbiting terror of Eugenia Insigna who stood well away from the scene Dont come any closer he had ordered Insigna sternly especially if youre going to look as though you were witnessing the sure beginning of calamity Youll panic the girl
	It seemed to Insigna that there were grounds for panic Marlene was too young to remember a world where airflight was common She had taken a rocket calmly enough to come to Erythro but how would she react to this unheard of flight through air
	And yet Marlene climbed into the cabin and took her seat with a look of utter calm on her face
	Was it possible she did not grasp the situation Genarr said Marlene dear you do know what were going to be doing dont you
	Yes Uncle Siever Youre going to show me Erythro
	From the air you know Youll be flying through the air
	Yes You said so before
	Does the thought of it bother you
	No Uncle Siever but its bothering you a lot
	Only on your behalf dear
	Ill be perfectly all right She turned her calm face toward him as he climbed in after her and took his seat She said I can understand Mother being concerned but youre more concerned than she is Youre managing to show it less in any big way but if you could see yourself licking your lips you would be embarrassed You feel that if something bad happens it will be your fault and you just cant stand the thought Just the same nothings going to happen
	Are you sure of that Marlene
	Absolutely sure Nothing will harm me on Erythro
	You said that about the Plague but were not talking about that now
	It doesnt matter what were talking about Nothing will harm me on Erythro
	Genarr shook his head slightly in disbelief and uncertainty and then wished he hadnt for he knew she read that as easily as though it were appearing in the largest block letters on the computer screen But what was the difference If he had repressed it all and had acted as if he were made of cast bronze she would still have seen it
	He said Well go into an airlock and stay there just a while so that I can check the responsiveness of the vessels brain Then we will go through another door and the plane will then move up in the air Therell be an acceleration effect and youll be pressed backward and well be moving in the air with nothing beneath us You understand that I hope
	I am not afraid said Marlene quietly
The aircraft remained on its steady course across a barren landscape of rolling hills
	Genarr knew that Erythro was geologically alive and knew also that what geological studies had been made of the world indicated that there had been periods in its history when it had been mountainous And there were still mountains here and there on the cisMegan hemisphere the hemisphere in which the bloated circle of the planet Megas around which Erythro orbited hung almost motionless in the sky
	Here on the transMegan side however plains and hills were the chief feature of the two large continents
	To Marlene who had never seen a mountain in her life even the low hills were exciting
	There were rivulets on Rotor of course and from the height at which they were viewing Erythro these rivers looked no different
	Genarr thought Marlene will be surprised when she sees them at a closer view
	Marlene look curiously at Nemesis which had passed its noonmark and had declined toward the west She said Its not moving is it Uncle Siever
	Its moving said Genarr Or at least Erythro is turning relative to Nemesis but it turns only once a day while Rotor turns once every two minutes In comparison Nemesis as seen from here on Erythro is moving less than th as fast as it seems to be moving as seen from Rotor It seems to be standing still here by comparison but it isnt standing entirely still
	Then casting a quick glance at Nemesis he said Youve never seen Earths Sun the Sun of the Solar System you know or if you have you dont remember it having been a baby at the time The Sun was much smaller as seen from Rotors position in the Solar System
	Smaller said Marlene in surprise The computer told me that it was Nemesis that was smaller
	In reality yes Still Rotor is so much closer to Nemesis than it ever was to the Sun in the old days that Nemesis seems larger
	Were four million kilometers from Nemesis arent we
	But we were a hundred fifty million kilometers from the Sun If we were that far from Nemesis wed get less than  percent of the light and warmth we get now If we were as close to the Sun as we are to Nemesis wed be vaporized The Sun is much larger brighter and hotter than Nemesis
	Marlene wasnt looking at Genarr but apparently his tone of voice was sufficient From the way you talk Uncle Siever I think you wish you were back near the Sun
	I was born there so I get homesick sometimes
	But the Sun is so hot and bright It must be dangerous
	We didnt look at it And you shouldnt look at Nemesis too long either Look away dear
	Genarr cast another quick glance at Nemesis however It hung in the western sky red and vast its apparent diameter at four degrees of arc or eight times that of the Sun as seen from Rotors old position It was a quiet red circle of light but Genarr knew that on comparatively rare occasions it would flare and for a few minutes there would be a white spot on that serene face that would be painful to look at Mild sunspots in darker red were more common but not as noticeable
	He murmured an order to the plane which veered sufficiently to put Nemesis farther to the rear out of direct view
	Marlene took a last thoughtful glance at Nemsis then turned her eyes to Erythros vista stretched out below
	She said You get used to the pink color of everything It doesnt look so pink after a while
	Genarr had noticed that himself His eyes caught differences in tint and shade so that the world began to seem less monochromatic The rivers and small lakes were ruddier and darker than the land surface and the sky was dark Little of the red light of Nemesis was scattered by Erythros atmosphere
	The most hopeless thing about Erythro however was the barrenness of the land Rotor even on its tiny scale had green fields yellow grain varicolored fruit noisemaking animals all the color and sound of human habitation and structures
	Here there was only silence and inanimation Marlene frowned There is life on Erythro Uncle Siever Genarr couldnt tell whether Marlene was making a statement asking a question or answering his thought as revealed by his body language Was she insisting on something or seeking reassurance
	He said Certainly Lots of life Its allpervasive Its not only in the water either There are prokaryotes living in the water films about the soil particles too
	After a while the ocean made its appearance on the horizon ahead first as simply a dark line then a thickening band as the air vehicle approached it
	Genarr cast careful sidelong glances at Marlene watching her reaction She had read about Earths oceans of course and must have seen images on holovision but nothing can prepare anyone for the actual experience Genarr who had been on Earth once once as a tourist had seen the edge of an ocean He had never been over one out of sight of land however and he wasnt sure of his own reactions
	It rolled back below them and now the dry land shrank behind into a lighter line and eventually it was gone Genarr looked down with a queer feeling in the pit of his stomach He remembered a phrase from an archaic epic the winedark sea Below them the ocean certainly did look like a vast rolling mass of red wine with pink froth here and there
	There were no markings to identify in that vast body of water and there was no place to land The very essence of location was gone Yet he knew that when he wanted to return he need do no more than direct the plane to take them back to land The planes computer kept track of position in accurate reckoning of speed and direction and would know where land waseven where the Dome was
	They passed under a thick cloud deck and the ocean turned black A word from Genarr and the plane lifted through and above the clouds Nemesis shone again and the ocean could no longer be seen beneath them There was instead a sea of pink water droplets billowing and rising here and there so that bits of fog moved occasionally past the window
	Then the clouds seemed to part and between their edges glimpses of the winedark sea could again be seen
	Marlene watched her mouth partly open her breath shallow She said in a whisper Thats all water isnt it Uncle Siever
	Thousands of kilometers in every direction Marleneand ten kilometers deep in spots
	If you fall into it I suppose you drown
	You neednt worry about that This vehicle wont fall into the ocean 
	I know it wont said Marlene matteroffactly
	There was another sight Genarr thought to which Marlene could well be introduced
	Marlene broke in on his thought Youre getting nervous again Uncle Siever
	Genarr felt amused at the manner in which he was learning to take Marlenes penetration for granted He said Youve never seen Megas and I was wondering if I ought to show it to you You see only one side of Erythro faces Megas and the Dome was built on the side of Erythro that doesnt face it so that Megas is never in our sky If we continue to fly in this direction however well enter the cisMegas hemisphere and well see it rise above the horizon 
	I would like to see that
	You will then but be prepared Its large Really large Nearly twice as wide as Nemesis and it looks almost like its about to fall on us Some people simply cant endure the sight It wont fall though It cant Try to remember that
	They moved along at a higher altitude and a heightened speed The ocean lay below in wrinkled sameness occasionally obscured by clouds
	Eventually Genarr said If youll look ahead and a little to the right youll see Megas beginning to show at the horizon Well turn toward it
	It looked like a small patch of light along the horizon at first but grew like a slow upward swell Then the widening arc of a deep red circle lifted itself above the horizon It was distinctly deeper than Nemesis which could still be seen to the right and in back of the plane and somewhat lower in the sky
	As Megas loomed larger it soon became apparent that what was being revealed was not a full circle of light a bit more than a semicircle 
	Marlene said with interest Now thats what they mean by phases isnt that right
	Exactly right We only see the part thats lit by Nemesis As Erythro goes around Megas Nemesis seem to move closer to Megas and we see less and less of the lit half of the planet Then when Nemesis skims just above or below Megas we just see a thin curve of light at Megas boundary thats all we see of its lighted hemisphere Sometimes Nemesis actually moves behind Megas Nemesis is then eclipsed and all the dim stars of night come out not just the bright ones that show even when Nemesis is in the sky During the eclipse you can see a large circle of darkness with no stars in it at all and that show you where Megas is When Nemesis reappears on the other side you began to see a thin curve of light again
	How marvelous said Marlene Its like a show in the sky And look at Megasall those moving stripes
	They stretched across the lighted portion of the globe thick and reddish brown interspersed with orange and slowly writhing
	Theyre storm bands said Genarr with terrific winds that blow this way and that If you watch closely youll see spots form and expand drift along then spread out and vanish
	It is like a holovision show said Marlene raptly Why dont people watch it all the time
	Astronomers do They watch it through computerized instruments located on this hemisphere Ive seen it myself in our Observatory You know we had a planet like this back in the Solar System Its called Jupiter and its even larger than Megas
	By now the planet had lifted entirely above the horizon looking like a bloated balloon that had somehow partially collapsed along its left half
	Marlene said Its lovely If the Dome were built on this side of Erythro everyone could watch it
	Actually not Marlene It doesnt seem to work that way Most people dont like Megas I told you that some people get the impression that Megas is falling and it frightens them
	Marlene said impatiently Only a few people would have such a silly notion
	Only a few to begin with but silly notions can be contagious Fears spread and some people who wouldnt be afraid if left to themselves become afraid because their neighbor is Havent you ever noticed that sort of thing
	Yes I have she said with a touch of bitterness If one boy thinks a bimbo is pretty they all do They start competing She paused as if in embarrassment
	The contagious fear is one reason we built the Dome on the other hemisphere Another is that with Megas always in the sky astronomic observations are more difficult to make in this hemisphere But I think its time we begin our return You know your mother Shell be in a panic
	Call her and tell her were all right
	I dont have to This ship is sending out signals continuously She knows were all rightphysically But thats not what shes worried about he said tapping his temple significantly
	Marlene slumped in her chair and a look of deep discontent crossed her face What a pain I know everyone will say Its just because she loves you but its such a bother Why cant she just take my word for it that Ill be all right
	Because she loves you said Genarr as he quietly instructed the aircraft to return home just as you love Erythro
	Marlenes face brightened at once Oh I do
	Yes yes Its quite visible in your every reaction to the world And Genarr wondered how Eugenia Insigna would react to that 
	She reacted in fury What do you mean she loves Erythro How can she love a dead world Is it possible you brainwashed her Is there some reason youve talked her into loving it
	Eugenia be reasonable Do you really believe it is possible to brainwash Marlene into anything Have you ever succeeded in doing so
	Then what happened
	Actually I tried to subject her to situations that would displease or frighten her If anything I tried to brainwash her into disliking Erythro I know from experience that Rotorians brought up in the tight little world of a Settlement hate the endlessness of Erythro they dont like the redness of the light they dont like that enormous puddle of an ocean they dont like darkening clouds they dont like Nemesis and most of all they dont like Megas All these things tend to depress and frighten them And I showed all these things to Marlene I took her out over the ocean and then far enough out to show her Megas entirely above the horizon
	And
	And nothing bothered her She said she got used to the red light and it stopped looking so terribly red The ocean didnt in the least frighten her and most of all she found Megas interesting and amusing
	I cant believe it 
	You must Its true
	Insigna sank into thought then said reluctantly Maybe its a sign that shes already infected with thethe
	With the Plague I arranged for another brain scan as soon as we got back We still havent got the complete analysis but the preliminary inspection shows no change The mind pattern changes markedly and noticeably even in a light case of the Plague Marlene simply doesnt have it However an interesting thought just occurred to me We know that Marlene is perceptive that she can note all sorts of little things Feelings flow from others to her But have you ever detected anything that might seem the reverse Do feelings flow from her to others
	I dont understand what youre getting at
	She knows when Im uncertain and a little anxious no matter how I try to hide the fact or that Im calm and unafraid Is there any way though that she can force me or encourage me to become uncertain and a little anxiousor calm and unafraid If she detects can she also impose
	Insigna stared at him I think thats crazy she said her voice choked in disbelief
	Perhaps But have you ever noticed that sort of effect with Marlene Think about it
	I dont have to think Ive never noticed any such thing
	No muttered Genarr I suppose you havent She would certainly love to make you feel less nervous about herself and she certainly fails to bring that about HoweverIt is true though if we just cling to Marlenes perceptive ability that it has strengthened since she has arrived on Erythro Agreed
	Yes Agreed
	But its more than that Shes now strongly intuitive She knows that she is immune to the Plague She is certain that nothing on Erythro will harm her She stared down at the ocean in convinced knowledge that the aircraft wouldnt drop into it and drown her Has she had this kind of attitude back on Rotor Hasnt she felt uncertain and insecure on Rotor when there was reason to feel so just as any other youngster might 
	Yes Certainly
	But here shes a new girl Totally sure of herself Why
	I dont know why
	Is Erythro affecting her No no I mean nothing like the Plague Is there some other effect Something completely different Ill tell you why I ask I felt it myself
	Felt what yourself
	A certain optimism about Erythro I didnt mind the desolation or anything else Its not that I was desperately put off by it before that Erythro made me seriously uneasy but I never liked the planet On this trip with Marlene however I came nearer to liking it than ever before in my ten years of residence here It was possible I thought that Marlenes delight was contagious or that she might somehow be forcing it on me Or else whatever it is about Erythro that is affecting her may be affecting me tooin her presence
	Insigna said sarcastically I think Siever that you had better have a brain scan yourself
	Genarr raised his eyebrows Do you think I havent Ive undergone a check periodically ever since Ive been here Thereve been no changes except those inseparable from the aging process 
	But have you checked your mind pattern since getting back from the plane trip
	Of course First thing Im no fool The complete analysis isnt back yet but the preliminary work shows no change
	Then what are you going to do next
	The logical thing Marlene and I are going out of the Dome and out upon Erythros surface
	No
	Well take precautions Ive been out there before
	You perhaps said Insigna stubbornly Not she Never she Genarr sighed He whirled in his chair looking at the false window in the wall of his office as though he were trying to penetrate it and look out upon the redness beyond Then he looked back at Insigna
	Out there is a huge brandnew world he said one that belongs to no one and nothing except ourselves We can take that world and develop it with all the lessons weve learned from our foolish mismanagement of our original world We can build a good world this time a clean world a decent world We can get used to the redness We can bring it to life with our own plants and animals We can make sea and land flourish and start the planet on its own course of evolution
	And the Plague What of that
	We might eliminate the Plague and make Erythro ideal for us
	If we eliminate the heat and the gravity and alter the chemical composition we can make Megas ideal for us too
	Yes Eugenia but you must admit that the Plague is in a different category from heat gravity and global chemistry
	But the Plague is just as deadly in its own way
	Eugenia I think Ive told you that Marlene is the most important person we have
	She certainly is to me
	To you shes important simply because she is your daughter To the rest of us she is important for what she can do
	What can she do Interpret our body language Play tricks
	She is convinced she is immune to the Plague If she is that might teach us
	If she is Its childish fantasy and you know it Dont grasp at cobwebs
	Theres a world out there and I want it
	You sound like Pitt after all For that world will you risk my daughter
	In human history much more has been risked for much less
	More shame to human history And in any case its up to me to decide Shes my daughter
	And Genarr said in a low voice that seemed to contain infinite sorrow I love you Eugenia but I lost you once I have had this feeble dream of perhaps trying to undo that loss But now Im afraid I must lose you again and permanently Because you see Im going to tell you that its not up to you to decide It is not even up to me to decide It is up to Marlene Whatever she decides she will do somehow And because she may well have the ability to win humanity a world I am going to help her do what she wants to do despite you Please you must accept that Eugenia


TwentyFour Detector


	Crile Fisher studied the Superluminal with a frozen expression It was the first time he had seen it and a quick glance at Tessa Wendel made it quite plain that she was smiling with what he could only think of as proprietary pride
	It sat there in a huge cavern inside a triple web of security barriers There were human beings present but most of the work force consisted of carefully computerized nonhumanoid robots
	Fisher had seen many spaceships in his time and of a multiplicity of models used for a multiplicity of purposes but he had never seen one like the Superluminalnever seen one as repulsive in appearance
	Had he seen it without knowing what it was he might not have guessed even that it was a spaceship What did he say then On the one hand he did not want to anger Wendel On the other hand she was clearly waiting for his opinion and she just as clearly expected praise
	And so he said in a somewhat subdued voice It has an eerie kind of gracerather wasplike
	She had smiled at the phrase eerie kind of grace and Fisher felt he had chosen well But then she said What do you mean wasplike Crile
	Its an insect Im referring to said Crile I know youre not aware of insects much on Adelia
	We know about insects said Wendel We may not have Earths chaotic profusion
	You probably dont have wasps Stinging insects shaped rather like He pointed to the Superluminal They too have a large bulge in front another bulge in back and a narrow connecting unit
	Really She looked at the Superluminal with a sudden sparking of new interest Find me a picture of a wasp when you can I might understand the ship design better in the light of the insector vice versa for that matter
	Fisher said Why the shape then if it wasnt inspired by the wasp
	We had to find a geometry that would maximize the chance of the entire ship moving as a unit The hyperfield has a tendency to extend outward cylindrically to infinity actually and you let it have its way to some extent On the other hand you dont want to give in entirely You cant in fact so you have to seal it off in the bulges The field is just within the hull maintained and enclosed by an intense and alternating electromagnetic field andyou dont really want to hear all this do you
	Not any more I think said Fisher smiling slightly Ive heard enough But since Im finally allowed to see this
	Now dont be hurt said Wendel putting her arm around his waist It was all strictly on a needtoknow basis There were times when they hated having me around They kept muttering I imagine about this suspicious Settler who was entirely too nosy and wishing that I hadnt been the one who had designed the hyperfield so they could kick me out Now however things have lightened to the point where I could arrange to have you come and see it Youll be on it eventually after all and I wanted you to admire it She hesitated then added And me
	He looked across at her and said You know that I admire you Tessa without any need for anything like this And he put his arm around her shoulder
	Im continuing to get older Crile she said The process simply wont stop And Im also dismayingly satisfied with you Ive been with you seven years now going on eight and I havent felt the old urge to see what other men might be like
	Fisher said Is that a tragedy Perhaps its just the fact that youve been so absorbed in the project Now that the ship is completed youll probably have a feeling of release and enough time to begin hunting again
	No I havent the urge I just havent But how about you I know I neglect you at times
	Its all right When you neglect me for your work that suits me I want the ship as much as you do dear and one nightmare is that by the time it is finally ready you and I will be too old to be allowed on He smiled again this time with distinct ruefulness In your awareness of oncoming age Tessa dont forget that I too am no longer a lad In less than two years Ill be fifty But I have a question Im reluctant to ask for fear of disappointment but Im going to anyway
	Ask away
	You arranged to have me see the ship to be allowed into this holy of holies Somehow I dont think that Koropatsky would have allowed this if the project werent near completion Hes almost as diseased on security as Tanayama was
	Yes as far as the hyperfield is concerned the ship is ready
	Has it flown
	Not yet There are still things to do but they dont involve the hyperfield itself
	There have to be test flights I suppose
	With a crew aboard of course Theres no way of doing it crew less and still feel that the lifesupport systems will work Even animals wont give us the necessary assurance
	Who will go on the first trip
	Volunteers chosen from among those on the project who qualify
	How about you
	Im the only one who wont be a volunteer I must go I could trust no one else to make decisions in an emergency
	Then I go too said Crile No not you
	Fishers face instantly grew dark with anger The arrangement was
	Not on the test flights Crile
	When will they be over then
	Its hard to say It depends on what troubles may develop If all goes as smoothly as possible then two or three flights might suffice A matter of months
	When will the first test flight be
	That I dont know Crile Were still working on the ship
	You said it was ready to go
	Yes as far as the hyperfield is concerned But were installing the neuronic detectors
	What are those I never heard you mention them
	Wendel did not answer directly She looked around quietly and thoughtfully then said Were attracting attention Crile and I suspect that there are people here who feel nervous about your presence Lets go home
	Fisher did not move I take it you refuse to discuss this with me Even though it happens to be vital to me
	Well discuss itat home
	Crile Fisher was restless his fury increasing He refused to sit down and towered over Tessa Wendel who had shrugged and taken a seat on the white modular couch and was now looking up at him frowning
	Why are you angry Crile Fishers lips were trembling He pressed them together and waited before answering as though forcing himself to remain calm by sheer muscular effort
	He said finally Once a crew is made up without me it will be a precedent I wont ever get on It must be understood from the beginning that I am on the ship every time until we reach the Neighbor Starand Rotor I dont want to be left out
	Wendel said Why do you jump at conclusions You wont be omitted at the crucial time The ship isnt even ready to go yet
	Fisher said You said the ship was ready What are these neuronic detectors youre suddenly speaking of Its a device to keep me quiet to keep me distracted and then sneak the ship away before I realize Im left out Thats what theyre doing And youre playing along with it
	Crile youre mad The neuronic detector is my idea my insistence my desire She stared at him unblinking daring him to do something about it
	Your idea he exploded But She held out her hand as if to silence him Its something weve been working on concurrently with the ship Its not something that falls within my expertise but I have driven the neurophysicists onward rather mercilessly to have it And the reason Precisely because I want you on the ship when it leaves for the Neighbor Star Dont you see
	He shook his head Figure it out Crile You would if you werent blind with rage for no sane reason Its perfectly straightforward Its a neuronic detector It detects nerve activity at a distance Complex nerve activity In short it detects the presence of intelligence
	Fisher stared at her You mean what doctors use in hospitals
	Of course Its a routine tool in medicine and in psychology to detect mental disorders early onbut at meter distances I need it at astronomical distances Its not something new Its something old with a vastly increased range Crile if Marlenes alive shell be on the Settlement on Rotor Rotor will be there somewhere circling the star I told you that it would not be easy to spot If we dont find it quickly can we be sure that its not thereand not that we just somehow missed it like missing an island in the ocean or an asteroid in space Do we just continue searching for months or years to make sure that we havent just missed it that its really not there
	And the neuronic detector
	Will find Rotor for us
	Wont it be just as hard to detect
	No it wont The Universe is overrun with light and radio waves and all kinds of radiation and well have to distinguish one source from a thousand others or from a million others It can be done but its not easy and it may take time However to get the precise electromagnetic radiation associated with neurons in complex relationship is quite unique We are not likely to have more than one source exactly like thator if we do its because Rotor has built another Settlement There you have it I am as intent on finding your daughter for you as you are for finding her for yourself And why would I do that if I werent intent on having you on the flight with us Youll be there
	Fisher looked overwhelmed  And you forced the entire project to do this
	I have considerable power over them Crile And theres more to it as well This is highly confidential thats why I couldnt tell you at the ship
	Oh And what might that be Wendel said and there was a softness in her voice Crile I spend more time thinking of you than you think You dont know how strongly I want to spare you disappointment What if we find nothing at the Neighbor Star What if a sweep of the skies tells us definitely that there are no living intelligent lifeforms anywhere in its vicinity Do we go straight home and report that we found no sign of Rotor Now Crile dont go into one of your moods Im not saying that failure to find intelligence at the Neighbor Star will necessarily imply that Rotor and its people have not survived
	What else can it imply
	They might have been so dissatisfied with the Neighbor Star that they decided to move on elsewhere Perhaps they stopped long enough to mine some asteroids for new materials they would need for construction and for refurbishing the microfusion motors Then on they would go
	And if that were so how can we know where they would be
	Theyve been gone almost fourteen years With hyperassistance they can travel only at the speed of light If they have reached any star and settled in its neighborhood it would have to be at a star within fourteen lightyears distance of us There are not very many of those At superluminal velocity we can visit each of those With neuronic detectors we can quickly decide whether Rotor is in the neighborhood of any of them
	They might be wandering through space between stars at this very moment How would we detect them then
	We wouldnt but at least we increase our own chances just a bit if we investigate a dozen stars in six months with our neuronic detector instead of spending that much time investigating one star in a futile search And if we failand we have to face the fact that we might failthen at least we will return with considerable data on a dozen different stars a white dwarf a bluewhite hot star a Solar lookalike a close binary and so on Were not likely to make more than one trip in our lifetime so why not make it a good one and go down in history with a huge bang eh Crile
	Crile said thoughtfully I suppose youre right Tessa To comb a dozen stars and find nothing will be bad enough but to search a single star vicinity and return thinking that Rotor might have been somewhere else that was reachable but that we lacked the time to explore would be much worse
	Exactly
	Ill try to remember that said Crile sadly  Another thing said Wendel The neuronic detector might detect intelligence not of Earthly origin We wouldnt want to miss it
	Fisher looked startled But thats not likely is it
	Not at all likely but if it happens all the more reason not to miss it Especially if it is within fourteen lightyears of Earth Nothing in the Universe can be as interesting as another intelligent lifeformor as dangerous Wed want to know about it
	Fisher said What are the chances of detecting it at all if it is not of Earthly origin The neuronic detectors are geared for human intelligence only It seems to me that we wouldnt even recognize a really odd lifeform as being alive let alone as being intelligent
	Wendel said We may not be able to recognize life but we cant possibly fail to recognize intelligence in my view and its not life but intelligence that were after Whatever intelligence might be however strange however unrecognizable it has to involve a complex structure a very complex structureat least as complex as the human brain Whats more its bound to involve the electromagnetic interaction Gravitational attraction is too weak the strong and weak nuclear interactions are too shortrange And as for this new hyperfield were working with in superluminal flight it doesnt exist in nature as far as any of us knows but exists only when it is devised by intelligence
	The neuronic detector can detect an elaborately complex electromagnetic field that will signify intelligence no matter the form or chemistry into which that intelligence may be molded And we will be ready to either learn or run As for unintelligent life that is not at all likely to be dangerous to a technological civilization such as ourselvesthough any form of alien life even at the virus stage would be interesting
	And why must all this be kept secret
	Because I suspectin fact I knowthat the Global Congress will want us back very quickly so that they can be sure the project is successful and so that they can learn to build better models of superluminal vessels based on our experience with this prototype I on the other hand if things go well would certainly want to see the Universe and let them wait I dont say Ill definitely do it but I want the option held open If they knew I was planning thateven thinking it I suspect they would try to crew the ship with others whom they would consider more amenable to orders
	Fisher smiled weakly Wendel said Whats wrong Crile Suppose theres no sign of Rotor or its people Would you then just want to go back to Earth in disappointment The Universe at your fingertips but given up
	No Im just wondering how long will it take to put in the detectors and all the other things you might dream up In a little over two years Ill be fifty At fifty agents working for the Office are routinely taken off field duty They get desk jobs on Earth and are no longer allowed to take spaceflights
	Well
	In a little over two years I will no longer qualify for the flight Theyll tell me Im too old and the Universe wont be at my fingertips after all
	Nonsense Theyre going to let me go and Im over fifty right now 
	Youre a special case Its your ship
	Youre a special case too since I will insist on you Besides they wont find it so easy to get qualified people to go on the Superluminal It will be all we can do to persuade anyone to volunteer And theyll have to volunteer we cant risk placing the trip into the hands of unwilling and frightened draftees
	Why wouldnt they volunteer
	Because theyre Earthmen my good Crile and to almost all Earthmen space is a horror Hyperspace is a greater horror still and theyre going to hang back There is going to be you and me and were going to need three more volunteers and I tell you well have trouble getting them Ive sounded out many and I have two good people with a halfway promise ChaoLi Wu and Henry Jarlow I havent got my third yet And even if against all likelihood there are as many as a dozen volunteers theyre not going to cut you out in favor of anyone else for I will insist on your going with me as my ambassador to the Rotoriansif that becomes necessary And if even that is not enough I promise you that the ship will take off before youre fifty
	And now Fisher smiled with honest relief and said Tessa I love you You know I really do
	No said Wendel I dont know that you really do especially when you say it in that tone of voice as though the admission has caught you by surprise Its very odd Crile but in the almost eight years weve known each other and lived together and made love to each other youve never once said that
	Havent I
	Believe me Ive listened Do you know what else is odd Ive never said that I loved you and yet I love you It didnt start that way What do you suppose happened
	Fisher said in a low voice It may be that weve fallen in love with each other so gradually that we never noticed That may happen sometimes dont you think
	And they smiled at each other shyly as though wondering what they ought to do about it


TwentyFive Surface


	Eugenia Insigna was apprehensive More than that
	I tell you Siever I havent had a good nights sleep since you took her out in the aircraft Her voice degenerated into what in a woman of less firm character might almost have been described as a whine Wasnt the flight through airoff to the ocean and back and coming back after nightfall toowasnt that enough for her Why dont you stop her
	Why dont I stop her said Siever Genarr slowly as though he were tasting the question Why dont I stop her Eugenia we have gotten past the stage of being able to stop Marlene
	Thats ridiculous Siever Its almost cowardly Youre hiding behind her pretending shes allpowerful 
	Isnt she Youre her mother Order her to stay in the Dome Insignas lips compressed Shes fifteen I dont like to be tyrannical
	On the contrary You would love to be tyrannical But if you try shell look at you out of those clear extraordinary eyes of hers and say something like Mother you feel guilty of having deprived me of my father so you feel that the Universe is conspiring to deprive you of me as punishment and thats a silly superstition
	Insigna frowned Siever that is the stupidest thing Ive ever heard I dont feel any such thing and couldnt possibly
	Of course you dont I was just making something up But Marlene wont be Shell know from the twitching of your thumb or the movement of your shoulder blade or something just what is bothering you and shell tell you and it will be so true and so shameful I suppose that you will be too busy looking for ways to defend yourself and youll give in to her rather than have her keep peeling away the outer layers of your psyche
	Dont tell me thats whats happened to you
	Not much because shes fond of me and Ive tried to be very diplomatic with her But if I cross her I shudder to think what a shambles shell make of me Look Ive managed to delay her Give me credit for that She wanted to go out immediately after the plane trip And I held her off to the end of the month
	How did you do that
	Pure sophistry I assure you Its December I told her that in three weeks the New Year would begin at least if we go by Earth Standard time and how best to celebrate the beginning of  I asked her than to begin the new era of the exploration and settlement of Erythro You know she views her own penetration of the planet in that lightas the beginning of a new age Which makes it worse
	Why worse
	Because she doesnt view it as a personal caprice but as something of vital importance to Rotor or even to humanity perhaps Theres nothing like satisfying your personal pleasure and calling it a noble contribution to the general welfare It excuses everything Ive done it myself so have you so has everyone Pitt more than anyone else whom I know does it He has probably convinced himself that he breathes only to contribute carbon dioxide to the plant life of Rotor
	So by playing on her megalomania you had her wait
	Yes and it still gives us one more week to see if anything will stop her I might say though that my plea didnt fool her She agreed to wait but she said You think that if you delay me you will win your way at least a little bit into the affections of my mother dont you Uncle Siever Theres nothing about you that indicates you consider the coming of the new year of the slightest importance 
	How unbearably rude Siever
	Merely unbearably correct Eugenia Same thing perhaps Insigna looked away My affections What can I say
	Genarr said quickly Why say anything Ive told you I loved you in the past and I find that getting oldor getting olderhasnt much changed it But thats my problem Youve never treated me unfairly You never gave me reason to hope And if Im fool enough not to be able to take no for an answer what concern is that of yours
	It concerns me that youre unhappy for any reason
	That counts for a lot right there Genarr managed a smile Its infinitely better than nothing
	Insigna looked away and with obvious deliberation returned to the topic of Marlene But Siever if Marlene saw your motivation why did she agree to the delay
	You wont like this but Id better tell you the truth Marlene said Ill wait till the New Year Uncle Siever because perhaps that will please Mother and Im on your side 
	She said that
	Please dont hold it against her I have obviously fascinated her with my wit and charm and she thinks shes doing you a favor
	Shes a matchmaker said Insigna obviously caught between annoyance and amusement
	It did occur to me that if you could bring yourself to show an interest in me we could use that to persuade her into all sorts of things that she would think would further encourage the interestexcept that it would have to be real or she would see through it And if it were real she wouldnt feel it necessary to make sacrifices to bring about what was already so Do you understand
	I understand said Insigna that if it werent for Marlenes perceptiveness you would be positively Machiavellian in your approach to me
	Youve got me dead to rights Eugenia
	Well why not do the obvious thing Lock her up and eventually carry her onto the rocket back to Rotor
	Bound hand and foot I suppose Aside from not thinking we could do such a thing Ive managed to catch Marlenes vision Im beginning to think of colonizing Erythroa whole world for the taking
	And breathing their alien bacteria getting them into our food and water Insignas face curled into a grimace
	What of it We breathe drink and eat themto an extentright here We cant keep them out of the Dome altogether For that matter there are bacteria on Rotor that we breathe drink and eat too
	Yes but were adapted to Rotors life These are alien bits of life
	All the safer If were not adapted to them neither are they to us There are no signs they can possibly parasitize us They would simply be so many innocuous dust particles
	And the Plague
	Thats the real difficulty of course even in the case of something as simple as letting Marlene go outside the Dome We will of course take precautions
	What kind of precautions
	She would wear a protective suit for one thing For another Ill go out with her Ill serve as her canary
	What do you mean canary
	It was a device they had on Earth some centuries back Miners carried canariesyou know little yellow birdsinto mines If the air went bad the canary died before the men were affected but the men knowing there was a problem would get out of the mine In other words if I begin to act queerly well both be brought in at once
	But what if it affects her before it affects you
	I dont think it will Marlene feels immune Shes said that so many times that I have begun to believe her
	Eugenia Insigna had never before watched the New Year approaching with such a painful concentration on the calendar There had never been reason before For that matter the calendar was a vestigial hangover twice removed
	On Earth the year had begun by marking the seasons and the holidays that related to the seasonsmidsummer midwinter sowing harvestby whatever names they were called
	Crile Insigna remembered had explained the intricacies of the calendar to her and had reveled in them in his dark and solemn way as he did in everything that reminded him of Earth She had listened to him with a mixture of ardor and apprehension ardently because she wished to share his interest as that might draw them closer together apprehensively because she feared his interest in Earth might drive him away from her as eventually it did
	Strange that she still felt the pangbut was it dimmer now It seemed to her that she could not actually remember Criles face that she remembered only the remembering now Was it only the memory of a memory that stood between her and Siever Genarr now
	And yet it was the memory of a memory that held Rotor to the calendar now Rotor had never had seasons It had the year of course for it and all the Settlements in the EarthMoon system which left out only those few that circled Mars or that were being built in the asteroid belt accompanied Earth on its path around the Sun Still without seasons the year was meaningless Yet it was kept together with months and weeks
	Rotor had the day too fixed artificially at twentyfour hours during which sunlight was allowed to enter for half the time and blocked off for the other half It could have been fixed for any length of time but it was fixed at the length of an Earth day and divided into twentyfour hours of sixty minutes each with each minute consisting of sixty seconds The days and nights were at least uniformly twelve hours long
	There had been occasional movements among the Settlements to adopt a system of merely numbering days and grouping them into tens and multiples of tens into dekadays hectodays kilodays and in the other direction decidays centidays millidays but that was really impossible
	The Settlements could not set up each their own system for that would have reduced trade and communications to chaos N or was any unified system possible save that of Earth where  percent of the human population still lived and to which ties of tradition still held the remaining  percent Memory held Rotor and all the Settlements to a calendar that was intrinsically meaningless for them
	But now Rotor had left the Solar System and was a world that was isolated and alone No day or month or year in the Earthly sense existed It was not even sunlight that marked day from night for Rotor gleamed with artificial daylight and darkened to a light whisper twelve hours on and twelve hours off The harsh precision was not even broken by the gradual dimming and brightening at the boundaries that might simulate twilight and dawn There seemed to be no need And within this allSettlement division individual homes kept their illumination on and off to suit their whims or needs but counted the days by Settlement timewhich was Earth time
	Even here at the Erythro Dome where there was a natural day and night that was casually used as such by those in occupation it was the notquitematching Settlement day length still tied to that of Earth the memory of a memory that was used in official calculations
	The movement was now stronger to leave the day as the only basic measure of time Insigna knew for a fact that Pitt favored the decimalization of time measure and yet even he hesitated to suggest it officially for fear of rousing wild opposition
	But perhaps not forever The traditional disorderly units of weeks and months seemed less important The traditional holidays were more frequently ignored Insigna in her astronomical work used days as the only significant units Someday the old calendar would die and in the far unseen future new methods of agreedupon time marking would surely arisea Galactic Standard calendar perhaps
	But now she found herself marking off the time to a New Year that began arbitrarily On Earth at least the New Year began at the time of a solsticewinter in the northern hemisphere summer in the southern It had a relationship to Earths orbit around the Sun that only the astronomers on Rotor remembered clearly
	But noweven though Insigna was an astronomerthe New Year had to do only with Marlenes venture onto the surface of Erythroa time chosen by Siever Genarr only because it involved a plausible delay and accepted by Insigna only because she was officiously concerning herself with a teenagers notion of romance
	Insigna came out of her roaming through the depths of thought to find Marlene regarding her solemnly When had she entered the room so silently or was Insigna so tied into an inner knot as to be unaware of footsteps
	Insigna said in half a whisper Hello Marlene
	Marlene said solemnly Youre not happy Mother
	You dont have to be superperceptive to see that Marlene Are you still determined to step out on Erythro
	Yes Entirely Completely
	Why Marlene why Can you explain it so I can understand
	No because you dont want to understand Its calling me
	Whats calling you
	Erythro is It wants me out there Marlenes ordinarily glum face seemed suffused with a furtive happiness
	Insigna snapped When you talk like that Marlene you simply give me the impression that you are already infected by thethe
	The Plague Im not Uncle Siever has just had another brain scan taken of me I told him he didnt have to but he said we had to have it for the record before we left Im perfectly normal
	Brain scans cant tell you everything said Insigna frowning Marlene said Neither can a mothers fears Then more softly Mother please I know you want to delay this but I wont accept a delay Uncle Siever has promised Even if it rains even if its bad weather Im going out At this time of the year there are never real storms or temperature extremes There are almost never at any time of the year Its a wonderful world
	But its barrendead Except for germs  Insigna said spitefully But someday well put life of our own upon it Marlene looked away her eyes lost in dreaming Im sure of it she said
	The Esuit is a simple suit said Siever Genarr It doesnt have to withstand pressure Its not a diving suit or a spacesuit It has a helmet and it has a compressed air supply that can be regenerated and a small heatexchange unit that keeps the temperature comfortable And its airtight obviously
	Will it fit me asked Marlene looking at the display of thickish pseudotextile material with distaste
	Not fashionably so said Genarr his eyes twinkling It isnt made for beauty but for use
	Marlene said in a slightly exasperated tone Im not interested in looking beautiful Uncle Siever but I dont want to be slopping around in it If it makes walking hard it wont be worth it
	Eugenia Insigna interrupted She had been watching a little whitefaced and pinchlipped The suit is necessary to protect you Marlene I dont care how sloppy it is
	But it doesnt have to be uncomfortable Mother does it If it happens to fit it would protect me just the same
	This will fit fairly well actually said Genarr Its the best we could find After all we only have them in adult sizes He turned his head toward Insigna We dont use them much these days There was a time after the Plague died down that we did some exploring but by now we know the immediate surroundings quite well and on the rare occasions we do go out we tend to use enclosed Ecars
	I wish youd use an enclosed Ecar now
	No said Marlene obviously pained at the suggestion Ive been out in a vehicle I want to walk I want tofeel the ground
	Youre mad said Insigna discontentedly
	Marlene fired back Will you stop implying
	Wheres your perceptivity I wasnt referring to the Plague I mean just plain mad just mad in the ordinary sense I meanPlease Marlene youre driving me mad as well
	She then said Siever if these are old Esuits how do you know they dont leak
	Because weve tested them Eugenia I assure you theyre in good working order Remember Im going out with her and also in a suit
	Insigna was clearly seeking objections  And suppose you suddenly have to She waved her hand meaninglessly
	Urinate Is that what you mean That can be taken care of though its not comfortable Still it wont arise Weve emptied our bladders and were good for several hoursor should be And were not venturing far off so in case of emergency we can come back to the Dome We ought to leave now Eugenia Conditions are good outside and we should take advantage of that Here Marlene let me help you with your suit
	Insigna said sharply Dont sound so happy
	Why not To tell you the truth I would like to step out myself The Dome can easily start to feel like a prison you know Maybe if we all stepped out more our people could endure longer shifts in the Dome There you are Marlene we only have to fit on the helmet now
	Marlene hesitated Just a minute Uncle Siever She walked toward Insigna holding out her arm suited and bulky
	Insigna gazed at her mournfully
	Mother said Marlene Once again please be calm I love you and I wouldnt do this and cause you such anxiety just to please myself I do it only because I know I will be fine and that you need not be anxious And I bet you want to get into an Esuit also so you can come out and never lose sight of me but you mustnt
	Why mustnt I Marlene How will I forgive myself if something happens to you and Im not there to help you
	But nothing will happen to me And even if something does which it wont what could you do about it Besides youre so afraid of Erythro that your mind is probably open to all kinds of abnormal effects What if the Plague should strike you rather than me How would you expect me to live with that 
	Shes right Eugenia said Genarr Ill be out there with her and the best thing you can do is stay here and remain calm All Esuits are equipped with radios Marlene and I will be able to hear each other and we will be in communication with the Dome I promise you if she behaves queerly in any way at all if there is even the suspicion of oddness Ill have her inside the Dome at once And if I feel in any way not quite my own normal self I will come back at once bringing Marlene with me
	Insigna shook her head and did not look comforted as she watched the helmet being fitted first over Marlenes head and then over Genarrs
	They were near the Domes main airlock and Insigna watched its manipulation She knew the lock procedure perfectly wellone could scarcely be a Settler otherwise
	There was the delicate control of air pressure to make sure that there would be a gentle transfer of air from the Dome outward never from Erythro inward There were computerized checks at every moment to make sure there were no leaks
	And then the inner door opened Genarr stepped into the airlock and beckoned Marlene inward She followed and the door closed The two were lost to immediate sight Insigna distinctly felt her heart miss a beat
	She watched the controls and knew exactly when the outer door slid open and then when it closed again The holoscreen sprang to life and she could see the two suited figures on it standing on the barren soil of Erythro
	One of the engineers handed a small earplug to Insigna who inserted it into her right ear An equally small microphone was fitted over her head
	A voice in her ear said Radio contact and at once the familiar voice of Marlene sounded Can you hear me Mother
	Yes dear said Insigna Her voice sounded dry and abnormal in her own ear
	Were out here and its wonderful It couldnt be nicer
	Yes dear  Insigna repeated feeling hollow and lost and wondering whether she would ever see her daughter in her right mind again
	Siever Genarr felt almost lighthearted as he stepped out upon the surface of Erythro The sloping wall of the Dome behind him reached upward but he kept his back to it for a sight so unErythronian would have spoiled the savor of the world
	Savor It was a queer word to use for Erythro for at the moment it had no meaning He lived behind the protection of his helmet breathing the air of the Dome or at least the air that had been purified and conditioned within the Dome He could not smell the planet or taste it within that shelter
	And yet there was a feel to it that made him oddly happy His boots crunched slightly upon the ground Although Erythros surface was not rocky it was rather gravelly and between the bits of gravel there was what he could only describe as soil There was of course ample water and air to break up the primordial surface rock and perhaps the ubiquitous prokaryotes had in their countless trillions added their own work patiently over the billions of years
	The soil felt soft It had rained the day before the soft and steady misty rain of Erythroor at least of this portion of Erythro The soil still felt slightly damp as a result and Genarr imagined the bits of soil the tiny scraps of sand and loam and clay each with its coat of water film that had been refreshed and renewed In that film prokaryotic cells lived happily basking in the energy of Nemesis building complex proteins out of simple ones while other prokaryotes indifferent to solar energy made use instead of the energy content of the remnants of those prokaryotes that in their countless trillions died during each moment of time
	Marlene was at his side She was looking upward and Genarr said gently Dont stare at Nemesis Marlene
	Marlenes voice sounded naturally in his ear It contained no tension or apprehension Rather her voice was filled with quiet joy She said Im looking at the clouds Uncle Siever
	Genarr looked up into the dark sky where by squinting for a while one could detect a faint greenishyellow gleam Against it were the feathery fairweather clouds that caught Nemesis light and reflected it in orange splendor
	There was an eerie quiet about Erythro There was nothing to make a sound No form of life sang roared growled bellowed twittered stridulated or creaked There were no leaves to rustle no insects to hum In the rare storms there might be the rumble of thunder or the wind might sigh against the occasional boulderif it blew hard enough On a peaceful calm day however as this one was it was silent
	Genarr spoke just to make sure that it was quiet and that he had not suddenly been struck deaf He couldnt have been to be sure for he heard the faint rasp of his own breath
	Are you all right Marlene
	I feel wonderful Theres a brook up there And she hastened her steps into an almost shambling run hampered as she was by her Esuit
	He said Watch out Marlene Youll slip
	Ill be careful Her voice was not dimmed by increasing distance of course since it was a radio beam that carried it
	Eugenia Insignas voice sounded suddenly in Genarrs ear Why is Marlene running Siever Then almost at once she added Why are you running Marlene
	Marlene did not bother to answer but Genarr said She just wants to look at some creek or other up ahead Eugenia
	Is she all right
	Of course she is Its weirdly beautiful out here After a while it doesnt even seem barrenmore like an abstract painting
	Never mind the art criticism Siever Dont let her get away from you
	Dont worry Im in constant contact with her Right now she hears what you and I are saying and if she doesnt answer its because she doesnt want to be bothered by irrelevancies Eugenia relax Marlene is enjoying herself Dont spoil it
	Genarr was indeed convinced that Marlene was enjoying herself Somehow he was too
	Marlene was running upstream along the brooks edge Genarr felt no great urgency to follow her Let her enjoy herself he thought
	The Dome itself was built on a rocky outcropping but the region in this direction was interlaced with small gently flowing brooks that all combined into a rather large river some thirty kilometers away that in turn flowed into the sea
	The brooks were welcome of course They supplied the Dome with its natural water supply once the prokaryote content was removed actually killed was the better word There had been some biologists in the early days of the Dome who had objected to the killing of the prokaryotes but that was ridiculous The tiny specks of life were so incredibly numerous on the planet and could proliferate so rapidly to replace any shrinkage of their numbers that no amount of ordinary killing in the process of ensuring a water supply could hurt them in any significant way Then once the Plague began a vague but strong hostility to Erythro rose up and after that no one cared what one did to the prokaryotes
	Of course now that the Plague did not seem to be much ofa threat any longer humanitarian feelings Genarr privately felt that biotarian was the better word might rise again Genarr sympathized with those feelings but then what would the Dome do for a water supply
	Lost in thought he was no longer looking at Marlene and the shriek sounded deafeningly in his ear Marlene Marlene Siever what is she doing 
	Now he looked up and was about to answer with automatic reassurance that nothing was wrong that all was well when he caught sight of Marlene
	For a moment he could not tell what she was doing He just stared at her in the pink light of Nemesis
	Then he made it out She was unhitching her helmet and was taking it off Now she was working at removing the rest of her Esuit
	He had to stop this
	Genarr tried to call out to her but in the horror of the emergency he couldnt find his voice He tried to run to her but his legs felt leaden and barely responded to the urgency of his feelings
	It was as though he found himself in a nightmare where dreadful things were happening and he could do nothing to prevent them Or perhaps his mind under the stress of events was dissociating from his body
	Is this the Plague striking at me Genarr wondered in panic And if so what will happen to Marlene now as she is baring herself to the light of N emesis and the air of Erythro


TwentySix Planet


	Crile Fisher had seen Igor Koropatsky only twice in the three years since he had assumed the post formerly held by Tanayama and had become the actualif not the titularhead of the project
	He had no trouble recognizing him however when the photoentry had signaled his image Koropatsky was still his portly outwardly genial self He was dressed well with a large and fluffy cravat in the latest style
	As for Fisher he had been relaxing through the morning and was scarcely presentable but one did not refuse to receive Koropatsky even when he came without warning
	Fisher signaled the tactful Hold image the cartoon figure of a welcoming host or hostess for the sex was made conventionally ambiguous with a hand upraised delicately in a gesture that was universally understood to mean Just a minute without the crassness of actually saying so
	Fisher had a few moments to comb his hair and adjust his clothes He might have shaved but he felt that Koropatsky would consider any further delay insulting
	The door slid aside and Koropatsky walked in He smiled pleasantly and said Good morning Fisher I intrude upon you I know
	No intrusion Director said Fisher making an effort to sound sincere but if you wish to see Dr Wendel she is Im afraid at the ship
	Koropatsky grunted You know I rather thought she might be I have no choice then but to talk to you May I sit down
	Yes of course Director said Fisher chagrined at not having offered Koropatsky a seat before the request was made Would you care for refreshment
	No Koropatsky patted his abdomen I weigh myself every morning and that alone is sufficient to cost me my appetitealmost Fisher I have never had a chance to talk to you man to man I have wanted to
	It is my pleasure Director mumbled Fisher beginning to grow uneasy What was this all about
	Our planet is in debt to you
	If you say so Director said Fisher You were on Rotor before it left
	That was fourteen years ago Director
	I know it was You were married on Rotor and had a child
	Yes Director said Fisher in a low voice
	But you returned to Earth just before Rotor left the Solar System
	Yes Director
	It was from something that was said to youand that you repeated hereplus another suggestion you made that led to Earths discovery of the Neighbor Star
	Yes Director
	And it was you who brought Dr Tessa Wendel from Adelia to Earth
	Yes Director
	And you have made it possible for her to work here for over eight years and kept her happy eh
	He chuckled deeply and Fisher felt that had Koropatsky been closer he would have dug his elbow into Fishers side in a mantoman fashion
	Fisher said cautiously We get along well Director
	But you have never married
	I am already married Director
	And separated fourteen years A divorce could be quickly arranged
	I also have a daughter
	Who would remain your daughter even if you married again
	It would be a meaningless formality surely
	Well perhaps Koropatsky nodded  And perhaps it even works better this way You know the superluminal ship is ready to move We hope to launch it at the beginning of 
	So I have been told by Dr Wendel Director
	The neuronic detectors are installed and work well
	I have been told that too Director
	Koropatsky held one hand in the other in his lap and nodded his large head ponderously Then he looked up quickly at Fisher and said Do you know how it works
	Fisher shook his head No sir I know nothing about the actual workings of the ship
	Koropatsky nodded his head again Nor I We have to accept the word of Dr Wendel and our engineers One thing is still lacking though
	Oh Cold anxiety swept over Fisher More delay What is lacking Director
	Communications I would think that if there is a device that can make a ship move much faster than light there should also be a device that would send waves or some other form of messagecarrying device faster than light too It seems to me it would be easier to send a superluminal message than drive a superluminal ship
	I cant say Director
	Yet Dr Wendel assures me that the reverse is true that as yet there is no method of efficient superluminal communication Eventually there will be she says but not now and she doesnt want to wait for such communication which she says may take a long time
	I dont want to wait either Director
	Yes Im anxious for progress and success Weve been waiting years already and I am eager to see the ship leave and return But it does mean that once the ship leaves we will be out of contact
	He nodded thoughtfully and Fisher maintained a discreet silence What was all this about What was the old bear getting at
	Koropatsky looked up at Fisher You know that the Neighbor Star is heading in our direction
	Yes Director Ive heard of that but it seems to be the common feeling that it will pass us at a great enough distance to leave us unaffected
	Thats the feeling we want people to have Now the truth is Fisher that the Neighbor Star will pass closely enough to disturb Earths orbital motion substantially
	Fisher paused for a moment in shock  And destroy the planet
	Not physically The climate will be sufficiently changed however so that Earth will no longer be habitable
	Is that certain said Fisher reluctant to believe it I dont know that scientists are ever really certain But they seem sufficiently close to certain to make it necessary for us to begin to take measures We have five thousand years and we are developing superluminal flightassuming the ship works
	If Dr Wendel says it will work Director Im convinced it will
	Lets hope your confidence is not misplaced Nevertheless even five thousand years with superluminal flight leaves us in a bad spot We would have to build a hundred and thirty thousand Settlements like Rotor to carry off Earths eight billion people plus enough plants and animals to set up viable worlds Thats twentysix Noahs Arks a year starting right now Thats assuming theres no increase in population over the next five thousand years
	Perhaps said Fisher cautiously we can handle an average of twentysix a year Our experience and expertise should increase with the centuries and our population control has worked for decades
	Very well Now tell me this If we do lift Earths population into space in one hundred and thirty thousand Settlements making use of Earths full resources plus those of the Moon Mars and the asteroids and abandon the Solar System to the gravitational mercies of the Neighbor Star where do all these Settlements go
	I dont know Director said Fisher We will have to find planets sufficiently Earthlike to accept our vast population without prohibitive requirements for terraforming We must think of that too and we must think of it now not five thousand years from now
	Even if we dont find suitable planets we can put the Settlements into orbit about suitable stars Inevitably Fisher made circular movements with his finger
	My dear man that wouldnt work
	With all respect Director it does work right here in the Solar System
	Not at all Theres a planet here in the Solar System that even today despite all the Settlements contains  percent of the human species We are still humanity and the Settlements are just a kind of fluff that surrounds us Could the fluff exist by itself We have no proof that they can and I think not
	You may be right Director said Fisher May be Theres no doubt about it said Koropatsky heatedly The Settlers affect to despise us but we fill their thoughts Were their history Were their model Were the teeming source to which they return again and again for reinvigoration Left to themselves they would wither
	You may be right Director but the experiment has never been tried We have never had a situation in which Settlements tried to exist without a planet
	But we have had such a situation at least in analogy In Earths early history human beings settled islands and were isolated from the mainstream The Irish settled Iceland the Norse settled Greenland the mutineers settled Pitcairn Island the Polynesians settled Easter Island Result The colonists withered sometimes disappeared entirely Always stagnation No civilization ever developed except in a continental area or in islands in close proximity to a continental area Humanity needs space size variety a horizon a frontier You see
	Fisher said Yes Director Past a certain point why argue So thatand Koropatsky put his right forefinger on his left palm didacticallywe must find a planet at least one planet to begin with Which brings us to Rotor
	Fisher raised his eyebrows in surprise To Rotor Director
	Yes In the fourteen years since theyve left whats happened to them
	Dr Wendel is of the opinion that they may not have survived He felt a pang saying it He always felt a pang when he thought about it
	I know she does Ive talked to her and Ive accepted what she has said without discussion But Id like your opinion
	I dont have one Director I have only the earnest hope that they have survived I have a daughter on Rotor
	Perhaps you still have Think What was there to have destroyed them A malfunctioning part Rotor is not a ship but a Settlement that for fifty years had had no serious malfunction It traveled through empty space between here and the Neighbor Star and what can be more harmless than empty space
	A miniblack hole an undetected asteroidal body
	What evidence Those are just guesses and of almost zero probability the astronomers tell me Is it something about the inherent properties of hyperspace that may have destroyed Rotor Weve been experimenting with hyperspace for years now and there is nothing inherently dangerous in it that we can find So we can suppose that Rotor reached the Neighbor Star safelyif thats where they went and all seem to agree that it makes no sense to suppose they went anywhere else
	I would like to think that they arrived safely
	But then the question arises If Rotor is safe at the Neighbor Star what is it doing there
	Existing It was halfway between a statement and a question But how Circling the Neighbor Star A single Settlement on an endless lonely journey about a red dwarf star I dont think so They would wither and it would not take them long to realize that I am sure they would wither fast
	And die Is that your conclusion Director
	No They would give up and come home They would acknowledge defeat and come back to safety However they have not done so and do you know what Ive been thinking Ive been thinking theyve found a habitable planet at the Neighbor Star
	But there cant be a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star Director Theres a shortage of energy unless you get so close that theres too much tidal effect He paused and muttered shamefaced Dr Wendel explained that to me
	Yes astronomers have explained it to me too Buthe shook his headexperience has taught me that no matter how sure scientists think they are nature has a way of surprising them Anyway do you understand why we are letting you go on this voyage
	Yes Director Your predecessor promised I would go in return for services rendered
	I have a better reason than that My predecessor who was a great man an admirable man was also a sick old man at the end His enemies thought that he had become paranoid He believed Rotor knew of Earths danger and had left without warning us because they wanted Earth destroyed and that Rotor must therefore be punished However he is gone and I am here I am not old or sick or paranoid Assuming Rotor is safe and is at the Neighbor Star it is not our intention to harm them
	Im glad of that but isnt this something you ought to discuss with Dr Wendel Director She is to be the captain of the ship
	Dr Wendel is a Settler You are a loyal Earthman
	Dr Wendel has worked loyally for years on the superluminal project
	That she has been loyal to the project is beyond question But is she loyal to Earth Can we count on her to carry out the letter and the spirit of Earths intentions toward Rotor
	May I ask Director just what Earths intentions are toward Rotor I take it that there is no longer the intention of punishing the Settlement for its failure to warn us
	That is correct What we want now is association human brotherhood only the kindliest of feelings With friendship established there must be a quick return with as much information as possible about Rotor and its planet
	Surely if Dr Wendel is told thisif she has this explained to hershe will carry it out
	Koropatsky chuckled One would think so but you know how it is She is a woman who is not in the first bloom of youth A fine womanI have no fault to findbut she is in her fifties
	What of that Fisher found himself offended
	She must know that when she comes back with the vital experience of a successful superluminal flight she will be more valuable to us than ever that she will be needed to design newer better more advanced superluminal vessels that she will have to train young people as superluminal pilots She will be quite sure that she will never be allowed to venture out through hyperspace again for she will simply be too valuable to risk Therefore before coming back she may be tempted to explore further She may not wish to abandon the thrill of seeing new stars and penetrating new horizons But we cannot have her take one risk more than she must take to reach Rotor gain the information and return We cannot afford the time lost either Do you understand His voice had become hard
	Fisher swallowed Surely you have no real reason
	I have every reason Dr Wendel has always been in a delicate position hereas a Settler You understand I hope Of all the people on Earth she is the one we depend on most and she is a Settler She has had to be the subject of a detailed psychological profile She has been extensively studied with and without her knowledge and we are quite certain that given the chance she will go off exploring And she will be out of communication with us We wont know where she is what she is doing We wont even know if she is alive
	And why are you telling me all this Director
	Because we know you have great influence over her She can be guided by youif you are firm
	I think perhaps you overestimate my influence Director
	I am sure we dont You too have been much studied and we know exactly how bound the good doctor is to youperhaps more than you yourself realize We know also that you are a loyal son of Earth You might have left with Rotor stayed with your wife and daughter but you returned to Earth at the cost of losing them You did that moreover knowing that my predecessor Director Tanayama would consider you a failure for failing to bring information back concerning hyperassistance and that your career might well be ruined That satisfies me that I can count on you to see to it that Dr Wendel is kept under firm control and is brought back to us quickly and that you will this timethis timebring back the information we need
	Ill try Director said Fisher You say that dubiously said Koropatsky Please understand the importance of what I am asking you to do We must know just what theyre doing how strong they are and what the planet is like Once we know all that we will know what we must do and how strong we must be and for what kind of a life we must be prepared Because Fisher we must have a planet and we must have it now And we have no choice but to take Rotors planet
	If it exists said Fisher hoarsely It had better exist said Koropatsky Earths survival depends upon it


TwentySeven Life


	Siever Genarr opened his eyes slowly and blinked at the light He had a little trouble focusing at first and couldnt quite make out whatever filled his vision
	The image sharpened slowly and soon Genarr recognized Ranay D Aubisson Chief Neurophysicist of the Dome
	Genarr said in a weak voice Marlene
	D Aubisson looked grim She seems well Its you Im concerned about right now
	A pang of apprehension made its way through Genarrs vitals and he tried to drown it with his sense of black humor He said I must be worse off than I thought if the Angel of the Plague is here
	Then as D Aubisson said nothing Genarr asked sharply  Am I She seemed to come to life Tall and angular she bent over him the fine wrinkles about her piercing blue eyes becoming more prominent as she squinted at him
	How do you feel she asked answering no questions
	Tired Very tired All right otherwise I think The rising inflection serve to repeat his earlier question
	She said Youve been sleeping for five hours She was still not answering
	Genarr groaned Im tired anyway And I have to go to the bathroom He began to struggle into a sitting position
	At D Aubissons signal a young man approached rapidly Respectfully he placed his hand under Genarrs elbow and was indignantly shaken off
	D Aubisson said Please let yourself be helped We have made no diagnosis yet
	When Genarr was back in bed ten minutes later he said ruefully No diagnosis Have you made a brain scan
	Yes of course Instantly
	Well
	She shrugged We found nothing of importance but you were asleep We will take another when youre awake And you must be observed in other ways
	Why Isnt the brain scan enough
	Her gray eyebrows rose Do you think it is
	No games What are you getting at Say it straight out Im not a child
	D Aubisson sighed The cases of the Plague we have had showed interesting features on brain scan but we were never able to compare it with the prePlague standard because none of the sufferers had been scanned prior to onset By the time we set up a routine and universal brain scanning program for all people in the Dome there were no longer any unmistakable cases of the Plague Did you know this
	Dont lay traps for me said Genarr pettishly Of course I knew of it Do you think my memory is gone I deduce thenI can still deduce too you knowthat although you have my scan of earlier days and can compare it with the scan you just took you found nothing of significance Is that it
	You obviously do not have anything remarkably wrong but we might have something we would consider a subclinical situation
	If you find nothing 
	We might not notice a subtle change if were not specifically looking for it After all you collapsed and you are not ordinarily given to collapsing Commander
	Take another scan now that Im awake then and if its something so subtle it escapes you then Ill live with it But tell me about Marlene Are you sure shes well
	I said she seems well Commander Unlike you she showed no abormality of behavior She did not collapse
	And is she safely inside the Dome
	Yes she brought you in herself just before you fell unconscious Dont you remember
	Genarr flushed and mumbled something
	D Aubissons look grew sardonic Suppose you tell us exactly what you do remember Commander Tell us everything Any of it may be important
	Genarrs discomfort increased as he tried to remember It seemed a long time ago and the edges were blurred very much as though it were a dream he was trying to recall
	Marlene was taking off her Esuit Then weakly Wasnt she
	Quite She came in without it and we had to send someone out there to retrieve it
	Well I tried to stop her of course when I noticed what she was doing Dr Insigna called out I remember and that alerted me Marlene was a distance away from me by the stream I tried to call out but in the shock of the situation I couldnt manage to make a sound just at first I tried to get to her quickly toto
	Run to her put in D Aubisson Yes butbut
	But you found you couldnt run You were almost in a state of paralysis Am I correct
	Genarr nodded Yes Rather I tried to run butdid you ever have one of those nightmares where you are pursued and somehow you cant manage to make yourself run
	Yes We all have those It usually comes when we have managed to tangle our arms or legs in the bedclothes 
	It felt like a dream I managed to get my voice at last and shouted at her but without the Esuit she couldnt hear me Im sure
	Did you feel faint
	Not really Just helpless and confused At though it were not even any use in trying to run Then Marlene saw me and ran toward me She must somehow have recognized I was in trouble
	She didnt seem to have any trouble running Is that right
	I wasnt aware that she was She seemed to reach me Then well be honest Ranay I dont remember after that
	You came into the Dome together said D Aubisson calmly She was helping you holding you up And once in the Dome you collapsed and nowhere you are
	And you think I have the Plague
	I think you experienced something abnormal but I can find nothing in your brain scan and I am puzzled There you have it
	It was the shock of seeing Marlene in danger Why should she be taking off her Esuit if she werent He stopped abruptly
	If she werent succumbing to the Plague Is that it
	The thought crossed my mind
	But she seems fine Would you like to sleep some more
	No Im awake Take another brain scan and see to it that it comes out negative because I feel much better now that I have the story off my chest And then Im going about my business you harpy
	Even if the brain scan is apparently normal Commander youll stay in bed for at least twentyfour hours For observation you understand
	Genarr groaned theatrically You cant do that I cant lie here and stare at the ceiling for twentyfour hours
	You wont have to We can set up a viewing stand for you so that you can read a book or enjoy holovision You can even have a visitor or two
	I suppose the visitors will be observing me too
	Its conceivable they may be questioned on the matter And now well set up the brain scan equipment again She turned away then turned back with a smile that softened slightly at the edges Its very possible youre all right Commander Your reactions seem normal to me But we must be sure mustnt we
	Genarr grunted and when D Aubisson turned again and walked away he made a face at her straight back That he decided was a normal reaction too
	When Genarr opened his eyes again it was to see Eugenia Insigna gazing at him sadly
	He looked surprised and began to sit up Eugenia
	She smiled at him but that did not make her face look less sad She said They said I could come in Siever They said you were all right
	Genarr felt a wave of relief He knew he was all right but it was nice to hear that his opinion was confirmed
	He said with bravado Of course I am Brain scan normal asleep Brain scan normal awake Brain scan normal forever But hows Marlene
	Her brain scan is perfectly normal too Even that did not lighten her mood
	As you see said Genarr I was Marlenes canary as I had promised I was affected by whatever it was before she was And then his mood changed It was no time for banter
	He said Eugenia how can I excuse myself to you I wasnt watching Marlene to begin with and I was too paralyzed with horror to do anything afterward I failed completely and did so after my telling you with such confidence that I would take care of her Honestly I have no excuse
	Insigna was shaking her head No Siever It was in no way your fault Im so glad she brought you in
	Not my fault Genarr felt dumbfounded Of course it was his fault
	Not at all Theres something much worse than Marlene foolishly removing her suit or you being unable to act quickly Much worse Im sure of it
	Genarr felt himself turning cold Whats much worse he thought What are you trying to tell me
	He swung himself out of bed and suddenly became aware of his bare legs and of the totally inadequate gown he was wearing He hastily draped the light blanket around himself
	He said Please sit down and tell me Is Marlene all right Are you hiding something about her
	Insigna sat down and looked solemnly at Genarr They say shes all right The brain scan is entirely normal Those who know about the Plague say she shows no symptoms
	Well then why are you sitting there as though its the end of the world
	I think it is Siever Of this one
	What does that mean
	I cant explain I cant reason it out You have to talk to Marlene to understand Shes going her own way Siever Shes not upset over what she did She insists that she cannot properly explore Erythroexperience Erythro is the phrase she useswith the Esuit on and she has no intention of wearing one any longer
	In that case she wont go out
	Oh but Marlene says she will Quite confidently Whenever she wishes she says And alone She blames herself for having let you come with her Shes not callous over what happened to you you see Over that she is upset And she was glad she reached you in time Really there were tears in her eyes when she talked about what might have happened if she hadnt walked you into the Dome in time
	Doesnt that make her feel insecure
	No Thats the oddest part of it Shes now sure that you were in danger that anyone would have been in danger But not she She is so positive Siever I could She shook her head then muttered I dont know what to do
	Shes a positive girl by nature Eugenia You must know that better than I do
	Not this positive Its as though she knows we cant stop her
	Perhaps we can Ill talk to her and if she pulls any of this You cant stop me when she talks to me Ill just send her back to Rotorand at once I was on her side but after what happened to me outside the Dome Im afraid Im going to have to be tough
	But you wont
	Why not Because of Pitt
	No I mean you just wont
	Genarr stared at her then laughed uneasily Oh come Im not that much under her spell I may feel like a kindly uncle Eugenia but Im not so kindly Ill let her walk into danger There are limits and youll find that I know how to set them He paused and said ruefully We seem to have changed sides you and I Before today it was you who insisted on stopping her and I who said it couldnt be done Now its the other way around
	Thats because the incident outside has frightened you and the experience since then has frightened me
	What experience since then Eugenia
	I tried to set the limits after she was back in the Dome I said to her Young lady dont you dare speak to me like that or far from not being able to leave the Dome you wont be able to leave your room Youll be locked in tied up if necessary and back to Rotor well go on the first rocket You see I was wild enough to threaten her all the way
	Well what did she do Im willing to bet a large sum she didnt burst into tears I suspect she gritted her teeth and defied you Right
	No I hadnt even gotten half the words out when my teeth started chattering and I couldnt speak A wave of nausea swept over me
	Genarr said frowning  Are you about to tell me that you think Marlene has some strange hypnotic power that can prevent us from opposing her Surely thats impossible Have you ever noticed anything like that in her before this
	No of course I havent I dont even see this in her now She has nothing to do with it I must have looked quite ill at the moment I was threatening her and that clearly frightened her She was very concerned She couldnt possibly have caused it and then reacted so And when you two were outside the Dome and she was taking off her Esuit she wasnt even looking at you She had her back to you I was watching and I know that Yet you found you couldnt do anything to interfere with her and when she realized you were in trouble she flew to your assistance She couldnt have deliberately done that to you and reacted in that fashion
	But then
	Im not through After I had threatened her or rather after I had failed to threaten her I scarcely dared say anything to her that wasnt perfectly superficial but you can be sure I kept my eye on her and tried not to let her see I was doing that At one point she talked to one of your guardsyou have them all over the place
	In theory muttered Genarr the Dome is a military post The guards merely maintain order help out when needed
	Yes I dare say said Insigna with a touch of contempt Thats Janus Pitt making sure he has a way of keeping you all under observation and under control but never mind Marlene and the guard talked for quite a while seemed to be arguing I went to the guard afterward after Marlene was gone and asked him what Marlene had talked to him about He was reluctant to say but I squeezed it out of him He said she wanted to arrange some sort of pass that would allow her to leave and reenter the Dome freely
	I said to him What did you tell her
	He said I told her that would have to be arranged at the Commanders office but that I would try to help her
	I was indignant What do you mean you would help her I said How could you offer to do that
	He said I had to do something maam Every time I tried to tell her it couldnt be done I felt sick 
	Genarr listened to all of this stonily Are you telling me that this is something Marlene does unconsciously that anyone who dares contradict her is made ill and that she doesnt even know that she is responsible for it
	No of course not I dont see how she can be doing anything at all If this were an unconscious ability of hers it would have made its appearance on Rotor and it never happened there And it isnt just any contradiction She tried for a second helping of dessert at dinner last night and quite forgetting that I didnt dare cross her I said sharply No Marlene She looked terribly rebellious but subsided and I felt in perfect health I can tell you No I think its only in connection with Erythro that one cant contradict her
	But why do you suppose that should be Eugenia You seem to have some notion or other about this If I were Marlene I would read you like a book and tell you what that notion is but since I am not you must tell me
	I dont think its Marlene at all whos doing this Itsits the planet itself
	The planet
	Yes Erythro The planet Its controlling Marlene Why else should she be so confident that she is immune to the Plague and that she will come to no harm It controls the rest of us too You came to harm when you tried to stop her I did The guard did Many people came to harm in the early days of the Dome because the planet felt it was being invaded so it produced the Plague Then when it seemed you were all content to remain within the Dome it let go and the Plague stopped See how it all fits in
	Do you think then that the planet wants Marlene out upon its surface
	Apparently
	But why
	I dont know I dont pretend to understand it Im just telling you how it must be
	Genarrs voice softened Eugenia surely you know that the planet cant do anything Its a lump of rock and metal Youre being mystical
	I am not Siever dont slip into this trick of pretending that Im a silly woman Im a firstclass scientist and theres nothing mystical about my thinking When I say the planet I dont mean the rock and metal I mean that theres some powerful permeating lifeform upon the planet
	It would have to be invisible then This is a barren world with no sign of life above the prokaryote let alone intelligence
	What do you know about this barren world as you call it Has it been properly explored Has it been searched through and through
	Slowly Genarr shook his head He said with a pleading note in his voice Eugenia youre drifting off into hysteria
	Am I Siever Think it out yourself and tell me if you can find an alternate explanation I tell you the life on the planetwhatever it is will not have us Were doomed And what it wants with Marlene her voice quaveredI cant imagine

	Officially it had a very elaborate name but it was spoken of as Station Four by those few Earthpeople who had occasion to mention it From the name it was at once apparent there had been three such objects earliernone of which were any longer in use having been cannibalized in point of fact There was also a Station Five that had never been finished and had become derelict
	It is doubtful if the vast majority of Earths population ever thought of the existence of Station Four which drifted slowly around Earth in an orbit well beyond that of the Moon
	The early stations had been Earths launching pads for the construction of the first Settlements and then when the Settlers themselves took over the job of building Settlements Station Four was used for Earths flights to Mars
	One such Martian flight was all that took place however for it turned out that the Settlers were far better suited psychologically to long flights living as they did in worlds that were large enclosed spaceships and Earth left it to them with a sigh of relief
	Station Four was now rarely used for any purpose and was maintained only as Earths foothold in space as a symbol that the Settlers were not the sole owners of the vastness beyond Earths atmosphere
	But now Station Four had a use A large cargo ship had lumbered out in its direction carrying with it the rumor among the Settlements that another attemptthe first in the twentythird centurywould be made to place an Earth team on Mars Some said it was merely for exploration some for the establishment of an Earth colony on Mars in order to bypass the few Settlements in orbit around the planet and some for the purpose eventually of establishing an outpost on some sizable asteroid that no Settlement had yet claimed
	What the ship actually carried in its cargo hold was the Superluminal and the crew that was to propel her to the stars
	Tessa Wendel even though she had been planetbound for eight years took the space experience calmly as any Settler by birth would naturally do Spaceships were far more like Settlements in principle than they were like the planet Earth And because of that Crile Fisher though he had been on many a spaceflight before was a bit uneasy
	This time something more than the unnaturalness of space contributed to the tension on board the cargo ship Fisher said I cant endure the waiting Tessa Its taken us years to reach this point and the Superluminal is ready and we still wait
	Wendel regarded him thoughtfully She had never intended to get this involved with him She had wanted moments of relaxation to rest a mind overcome with the complexity of the project so that it might return to work refreshed and keener That was what she had intended what she had ended up with was something much more
	Now she found herself helplessly tied to him so that his problems had become hers The years of his waiting would surely come to nothing and she worried about the despair that would follow his inevitable disappointment She had tried to dash cold water on his dreams judiciously tried to cool down his overheated anticipation of a reunion with his daughter but she had not succeeded If anything over this past year he had grown more optimistic about the possibility for no obvious reasonat least none he would explain to her
	Tessa was finally satisfied and relieved that it was not his wife Crile was looking for but only his daughter To be sure she had never understood this longing for a daughter he had last seen as an infant but he had volunteered no explanation and she had not wanted to probe the matter What was the use She was certain that his daughter was not alive that nothing on Rotor was alive If Rotor was there near the Neighbor Star it was a giant tomb drifting in space wandering foreverand undetectable except by incredible coincidence Crile Fisher would have to be kept steady and functioning once that inevitable prospect became clearly apparent reality
	Tessa said cajolingly Theres only a twomonth wait leftat most Since weve waited for years another two months wont hurt
	Its the waiting for years that makes even two months more unbearable muttered Fisher
	Tell yourself otherwise Crile said Wendel Learn to bow to necessity The Global Congress simply wont allow us to go any sooner The Settlements have their eyes on us and theres no way of being sure that they all accept the notion that were heading for Mars It would be strange if they did considering Earths poor record in space If we do nothing for two months they will assume were having troublesomething they would readily believe and find satisfaction inand withdraw their attention
	Fisher shook his head angrily Who cares if they know what were doing Well be off and gone and they wont duplicate superluminal flight for yearsand by that time well have a fleet of superluminal vessels and be moving rapidly forward toward opening up the Galaxy
	Dont take that for granted Its easier to imitate and overtake than it is to originate And Earths government considering its dismal record in space after the Settlements reached maturity is obviously anxious to establish unmistakable priority for psychological reasons She shrugged Besides we need the time to carry out more tests on the Superluminal under lowgravity conditions
	Theres never any end to tests is there
	Dont be impatient This is so new and untried a technique and so unlike anything humanity has ever had that it is all too easy to think of new tests especially since we are a little uncertain as to the manner in which moving into and out of hyperspace is affected by the level of intensity of a gravitational field Seriously Crile you cant blame us for being cautious After all as recently as a decade ago superluminal flight was considered theoretically impossible
	Even caution can be overdone
	Possibly Eventually I will decide that weve done all we can reasonably be expected to do and then well take off I promise you Crile we wont wait unreasonably I wont overdo caution
	I hope not Wendel looked at him doubtfully She had to ask She said You know Crile youre not yourself lately For the last two months youve seemed to be burning up with impatience For a while there you had cooled down and then you suddenly gained excitement again Has something happened that I dont know about
	Fisher calmed suddenly Nothings happened What can possibly have happened
	To Wendel it seemed he had calmed down too quickly had wrenched himself into a most suspicious affectation of normality She said Im asking you what can possibly have happened Ive tried to warn you Crile that we are not likely to find Rotor a functioning world or find it at all We will not find yourwe are not likely to find any of its inhabitants alive She waited through his stubborn silence then said Havent I warned you of thatpossibility
	Often  said Fisher
	 Yet you sound now as though you can hardly wait for what is sure to be a happy reunion It is dangerous to have hopes that are not likely to be fulfilled to pin everything upon them What has suddenly produced this new attitude Have you been talking to someone who was unjustifiably optimistic
	Fisher flushed Why do I have to have been talking to someone Why couldnt I have come to an independent conclusion concerning this or any other matter Just because I dont understand the theoretical physics that you do understand doesnt mean Im subnormal or brainless
	Wendel said No Crile I never thought anything of the sort about you nor did I mean to imply it Tell me what you think about Rotor
	Nothing terribly deep or subtle It just seemed to me that there was nothing in empty space that is very likely to have destroyed Rotor Its easy to say that there might only be the dead hulk of a Settlement at Rotor if it reached the Neighbor Star at all but what is it that would have destroyed them either on the way or once they were there I defy you to give me a specific scenario of destructioncollisionsalien intelligenceswhatever
	Wendel said earnestly Crile I cant I have no mystical visions of something having happened Its just hyperassistance itself Its a tricky technique Crile Take my word for it It doesnt use either space or hyperspace in a steady way but skids along at the interface wobbling to one side or another for short periods and moving from space to hyperspace and then from hyperspace back to space several times a minute perhaps The passage from one to the other may therefore have taken place a million times or more in the course of the trip from here to the Neighbor Star
	And so
	And so it happens that the transition is far more dangerous than is level flight in either space or hyperspace I dont know how thoroughly the Rotorians had established hyperspatial theory but the chances are that they had done so in only a rudimentary fashion or they would have surely developed true superluminal flight In our project which has worked out hyperspatial theory in great detail weve managed to establish the effect on material objects of passing from space to hyperspace and vice versa
	If an object is a point there is no strain on it during the transition If an object is not a point howeverif it is an extended bit of matter as any ship would bethen there is always a finite period of time during which part of it is in space and part is in hyperspace This creates a strainthe amount of strain depending on the size of the object its physical makeup its speed of transition and so on Even for an object the size of Rotor the danger involved in a single transitionor a dozen for that matteris so small that it can reasonably be ignored
	When the Superluminal will travel superluminously to the Neighbor Star we are liable to make a dozen transitions or possibly only as few as two The flight will be a safe one In a flight with hyperassistance only on the other hand there may be a million transitions in the course of the same trip you see and the chances of fatal strain mount up
	Fisher looked appalled Is the chance of fatal strain certain
	No nothing is certain Its a statistical matter A ship might undergo a million transitionsor a billionwith nothing happening It might be destroyed on the other hand on the very first transition The chances however increase rapidly with the number of transitions
	I suspect then that Rotor embarked on its trip understanding very little about the dangers of transition Had they known more they would never have left There is a very good chance then that they experienced some sort of strain that might have been weak enough to allow them to limp to the Neighbor Star or one that was strong enough to blow them completely out of existence Therefore we might find a hulk or we might find nothing at all
	Or we might find a Settlement that has survived said Fisher rebelliously
	Admitted said Wendel Or we might ourselves be strained against the odds be destroyed and for that reason find nothing I ask you not to be prepared for certainties but for probabilities And remember that those who think about the matter without some accurate knowledge of hyperspatial theory are not likely to come to reasonable conclusions
	Fisher fell into a profound and clearly depressed silence while Wendel watched him uneasily
	Tessa Wendel found Station Four a weird environment It was as though someone had built a small Settlement but fitted it out to be a combination of nothing more than a laboratory an observatory and a launching platform It had no farms no homes none of the appurtenances of a Settlement however small It was not even equipped with a spin that would set up an adequate pseudogravitational field
	It was in fact nothing but a spaceship with acromegaly It was clear that although it could be permanently occupied provided there was a continuous drizzle of food air and water supplies there was some recycling but it wasnt efficient no single individual could remain there for very long
	Crile Fisher made the wry comment that Station Four was like an oldfashioned space station from the early days of the Space Age that had unaccountably survived into the twentythird century
	In one respect though it was unique It presented a panoramic view of the EarthMoon system From the Settlements that orbited Earth the two bodies could rarely be seen in their true relationship From Station Four however Earth and Moon were never more than fifteen degrees apart and as Station Four revolved around the center of gravity of that system roughly equivalent to revolving about the Earth the changing pattern of the two worlds both in position and phase and the changing size of the Moon depending on whether it was on the Stations own side of Earth or on the opposite side was a neverending wonder
	The Sun was blocked out automatically by the Artec device Wendel had to ask to find out that that stood for  Artificial Eclipse device and only when the Sun moved too near either Earth or Moon in the stations sky was the view spoiled
	Wendels Settlement background showed up now for she enjoyed watching the EarthMoon interplay mostly she explained because it made it clear she was no longer on Earth
	She said as much to Fisher who smiled dourly He had noticed her quick glance to right and left as she said it
	He said I see you dont mind telling me that even though Im an Earthman and might resent it But never fear I wont pass it along
	Id trust you with anything Crile She smiled at him happily He had changed considerably since that crucial conversation when they had first reached Station Four He was somber yes but sooner that than the feverish expectation of what could not be
	He said Do you really think they resent your being a Settler at this stage of the game
	Of course they do They never forget Theyre as narrowminded as I am and I never forget theyre Earthpeople
	You obviously forget Im an Earthman
	Thats because youre Crile and fall into no category other than Crile And Im Tessa And that ends it
	Fisher said thoughtfully Does it ever bother you Tessa that you have worked out superluminal flight for Earth rather than for your own Settlement Adelia
	But I havent done it for Earth and I wouldnt have done it for Adelia in other circumstances In both cases Im doing it for myself I had a problem to solve and I completed the job successfully Now Im going down in history as the inventor of superluminal flight and thats what Ive done for myself And it may sound pretentious but Im doing it for humanity too It doesnt matter on which world the discovery is made you know Some person or persons on Rotor invented hyperassistance but we have it now and so do all the settlements In the end the Settlements will all have superluminal flight too Wherever an advance takes place ultimately all humanity is helped
	Earth needs it more than the Settlements do though
	You mean because of the approach of the Neighbor Star which the Settlements can easily evade by leaving if necessary but which Earth cant Well Ill leave that as a problem for Earths leaders Ive supplied the tool and they can work out methods for using it to their best advantage
	Crile said I understand were taking off tomorrow
	Yes finally Theyll be taking holographic recordings and give us the full treatment Theres no way of telling though when theyll be able to release them to the general public and the Settlements
	It cant be till after our return said Fisher Thered be no sense in putting them on display if they cant be certain well ever come back Its going to be an agonizing wait for them too since theyll have no contact with us at all When the astronauts first landed on the Moon they were in touch with the Earth all the way
	True said Wendel but when Columbus sailed off into the Atlantic the Spanish monarchs never heard from him again till he returned seven months later
	Fisher said Earth now has far more at stake than Spain had seven and a half centuries ago It is really a great pity we cant have superluminal communication since we have superluminal flight
	I think so too As does Koropatsky who has been hammering at me to work out telecommunication But as I told him I am not a marvelous supernatural force who can crank out everything anyone needs It is one thing to push mass through hyperspace and quite another to push some sort of radiation through hyperspace They follow different rules even in ordinary space so that Maxwell didnt work out his electromagnetic equations until two centuries after Newton worked out his gravitational equation Well mass and radiation follow different rules in hyperspace too and the rules for radiation still defeat us Someday well work out superluminal communication but we havent yet
	Its too bad said Fisher thoughtfully Its possible that without superluminal communication superluminal flight wont be practical
	Why not
	The lack of superluminal communication cuts the umbilical cord Could Settlements live far from Earthfar from the rest of humanity and survive
	Wendel frowned Whats this new line of philosophy youve begun to track down
	Just a thought Being a Settler Tessa and being accustomed to it it may not occur to you that living on a Settlement is not truly natural to human beings
	Really It never seemed unnatural to me
	Thats because you werent really living on one You were living in a whole system of Settlements among which one was a large planet with billions of people on it Might not the Rotorians once they reach the Neighbor Star find that living on an isolated Settlement was unsatisfactory In that case they would surely return to Earth but they havent Might that not be because they have found a planet to live on
	A habitable planet circling a red dwarf star Most unlikely
	Nature has a way of fooling us and upsetting supposed certainties
	Suppose there is a habitable planet there Shouldnt it be carefully studied
	Wendel said Ah Im beginning to get what youre driving at You feel that the ship may come to the Neighbor Star and find that there is some sort of planet there We would then make a note of it decide from a distance that it is uninhabited and go on about our task of further exploration You would want us to land and make a much more thorough search so that we can at least try to find your daughter But what if our neuronic detector finds no trace of intelligence anywhere within any planetary system the Neighbor Star may have Must we still search the individual planets
	Fisher hesitated Yes If they show any signs of being habitable we must study them it seems to me We must know all we can about any such planet We may have to begin evacuating Earth soon and we must know where to take our people Its all very well for you to overlook that since Settlements can just drift off without the necessity of evacua
	Crile Dont start treating me as the enemy Dont start suddenly thinking of me as a Settler Im Tessa If there is a planet well investigate it as much as we can I promise you But if there is and if the Rotorians are occupying it thenWell you spent some years on Rotor Crile You must know Janus Pitt
	I know of him I never met him but my wimy exwife worked with him According to her he was a very capable man very intelligent very forceful
	Very forceful We knew of him on other Settlements too And we were not generally fond of him If it was his plan to find a place for Rotor that was hidden from the rest of humanity he could do no better than to go to the Neighbor Star since it was so close and since its existence was not known by anyone outside Rotor at the time And if for any reason he wanted a system all to himself he would being Janus Pitt fear the possibility of being followed and having his monopoly upset If he happened to find a useful planet that could be used by Rotor he would be even more resentful of intrusion
	What are you getting at asked Fisher who looked perturbed as though he knew what she was getting at
	Why tomorrow we take off and in not too long a time well be at the Neighbor Star And if it does have a planet as you seem to think it might and if we find the Rotorians are occupying it its not going to be a matter of just going down to the surface and saying Hello Surprise Im afraid that at the first sight of us he would give us his version of a Hello and blast us into oblivion


TwentyNine Enemy


	Ranay D Aubisson like all the inhabitants of the Erythro Dome during their period of habitation visited Rotor periodically It was necessarya touch of home a return to the roots a gathering of renewed strength
	This time however D Aubisson had moved upward the usual phrase for passing from Erythro to Rotor a bit earlier than her schedule had called for She had indeed been summoned by Commissioner Pitt
	She sat in Janus Pitts office noting with her skilled eyes the small signs of aging that had accumulated since she had last seen him several years before She did not in the ordinary course of her work have frequent occasions to see him of course
	His voice however was as strong as ever his eyes as sharp and she noted no decline in mental vigor
	Pitt said I have received your report on the incident outside the Dome and I recognize the caution with which you approached your diagnosis of the situation But now off the record and unofficially exactly what happened to Genarr This room is shielded and you can talk freely
	D Aubisson said dryly Im afraid that my report cautious as it was happens to be truthful and complete We dont really know what happened to Commander Genarr The brain scan showed changes but these were extraordinarily small and did not correspond to anything in our past experience And they were reversible since they did in fact quickly reverse
	But something did happen to him
	Oh yes but thats the point We cant say anything more than something 
	Some form of the Plague perhaps
	None of the symptoms that have been detected in the past were found in this case
	But in the old days of the Plague brain scanning was still comparatively primitive You would not have detected the symptoms you have detected now in the past so it might still be a mild form of the Plague might it not
	We could say so but we could not present real evidence to that effect and in any case Genarr is now normal
	He seems normal I suppose but we dont really know if there might not be a relapse
	Neither is there any reason to suppose there might be
	A fleeting look of impatience crossed the Commissioners face Youre sparring with me D Aubisson You know perfectly well that Genarrs position is one of considerable importance The situation in the Dome is always precarious since we never know if and when the Plague will strike again Genarrs value was that he seemed immune to it but we can scarcely consider him immune now Something happened and we must be prepared to replace him
	That is your decision to make Commissioner I am not suggesting replacement as a medical necessity
	But youll keep him under close observation and youll keep the possibility of such a necessity in mind I hope
	I would consider that part of my medical duties
	Good Especially since if there is to be a replacement I have been considering you
	Considering me A small flash of excitement crossed her face before she could suppress it
	Yes why not Its well known that Ive never been enthusiastic about the project of colonizing Erythro I have always felt it necessary to retain the mobility of humanity and not to allow ourselves to be trapped into slavery to a large planet again Nevertheless it would be wise if we could colonize the planet not as a place intended primarily for population but as a vast resourcerather as we treated the Moon in the old Solar System But we cant do that if the Plague hangs over our heads can we
	No we cant Commissioner
	So our real task to begin with is to solve that problem We never have The Plague just died down and we have accepted thatbut this latest incident shows us that the danger is not yet gone Whether Genarr suffered a touch of the Plague or not he certainly suffered something and I want the matter now given top priority You would be the natural person to head that project
	Id be glad to accept the responsibility It would mean doing what I am in any case trying to do but with greater authority I hesitate at supposing that I ought to be the Erythro Dome Commander
	As you said thats for me to decide I take it you would not refuse the post if it were offered to you
	No Commissioner I would be greatly honored
	Yes Im sure said Pitt dryly  And what happened to the girl For a moment D Aubisson seemed taken aback by the sudden change in subject She all but stammered as she repeated The girl
	Yes the girl who was outside the Dome with Genarr the one who removed her protective suit
	Marlene Fisher
	Yes thats her name What happened to her
	D Aubisson hesitated Why nothing Commissioner
	So it says in the report But Im asking you now Nothing
	Nothing detectable by brain scan or in any other way
	You mean that at the same time that Genarr wearing an Esuit was struck down the girl this Marlene Fisher without an Esuit suffered nothing
	D Aubisson shrugged Nothing at all as far as we could tell
	Dont you consider that strange
	Shes a strange young woman Her brain scan
	I know about her brain scan I know also that she has peculiar abilities Have you noted that
	Oh yes I have indeed
	And how do her abilities strike you Mind reading by any chance
	No Commissioner Thats impossible The concept of telepathy is a mere fantasy I wish it were mind reading in fact since that would not be so dangerous Thoughts can be placed under control
	What is it about her that is more dangerous
	Apparently she reads body language and we cant control that Every motion speaks She said it with a touch of bitterness that Pitt did not fail to note
	He said Did you have a personal experience of that
	Certainly D Aubisson looked grim It is impossible to be near the young woman without experiencing some of the inconvenience of her habit of perception
	Yes but what happened
	Nothing of tremendous importance but it was annoying D Aubisson flushed and for a moment her lips pressed together as though she were thinking of defying her interrogator But that moment passed She said almost in a whisper  After I had examined Dome Commander Genarr Marlene asked me how he was I told her that he was not seriously harmed and that there was every hope that he would recover completely
	She said Why does that disappoint you
	I was taken aback and said Im not disappointed Im pleased She said But you are disappointed That is quite clear Youre impatient
	It was the first time I had encountered that sort of thing directly though I had heard about it from others and I couldnt think of anything to do but challenge her Why should I be impatient For what
	She looked at me solemnly with her large dark and unsettling eyes Then she said It seems to be about Uncle Siever 
	Pitt interrupted Uncle Siever Is there a relationship
	No I think its only a term of affection She said It seems to be about Uncle Siever and I wonder if you want to replace him as Dome Commander
	At that I just turned and walked away
	Pitt said How did you feel when she told you this
	I was furious Naturally
	Because she had maligned you Or because she was correct
	Well in a way
	No no Dont hedge Doctor Was she wrong or was she right Were you sufficiently disappointed at Genarrs recovery for the girl to notice or was the whole thing a stroke of her peculiar imagination
	The words seemed to force themselves out of D Aubissons lips She sensed something that was really there She stared at Pitt defiantly Im only human and I have my impulses And you yourself have now indicated that I might be offered the post which would seem to mean you consider me qualified for it
	Im sure you are maligned in spiritif not in fact said Pitt without any sign of humor But now considerYou have this young woman who is peculiar who is very strange both as shown by the brain scan and by her behaviorand in addition she seems unaffected by the Plague Clearly there may be a connection between her neuronic pattern and her Plague resistance Might she not be a useful tool for studying the Plague
	I cant say I suppose its conceivable
	Shouldnt it be tested
	Perhaps but how Pitt said quietly Let her be exposed to the influence of Erythro as much as possible
	D Aubisson said thoughtfully That is what she wants to do as it happens and Commander Genarr seems to be willing to let her
	Good Then you will supply the medical backing
	I understand And if the young woman gets the Plague
	We must remember that the solution of the problem is more important than the welfare of a single individual We have a world to win and for that we might have to pay a sad but necessary price
	And if Marlene is destroyed and that does not help us understand or counteract the Plague
	Pitt said That risk must be faced After all it might also be that she will remain untouched and that that untouchability carefully studied may give us the means of a breakthrough in understanding the Plague In that case we win without loss
	It was only afterward when D Aubisson had left for her Rotorian apartment that Pitts iron resolution permitted him to think of himself as Marlene Fishers confirmed enemy True victory would be to have Marlene destroyed and the Plague remain unsolved At a stroke he would be rid of an inconvenient girl who might otherwise someday produce young like herself and of an inconvenient world that might otherwise someday produce a population as undesirable as dependent and as immobile as Earths population had been
	The three of them sat together in the Erythro DomeSiever Genarr watchful Eugenia Insigna deeply concerned and Marlene Fisher clearly impatient
	Insigna said Now remember Marlene do not stare at Nemesis I know youve been warned about the infrared but its also a fact that Nemesis is a mild flare star Every once in a while theres an explosion on its surface and a burst of white light It just lasts a minute or two but that will be enough to shock your retinas and you cant tell when its going to happen
	Genarr said Can astronomers tell when its going to happen
	Not so far Its one of the many chaotic aspects of nature We have not yet worked out the rules underlying stellar turbulence and there are some among us who think the rules can never be worked out entirely They are simply too complex
	Interesting said Genarr
	Its not that were not grateful to the flares Three percent of the energy reaching Erythro from Nemesis is the result of those flares
	That doesnt sound like much
	It is though Without the flares Erythro would be an icy world and much less easy to live on The flares do make problems for Rotor which has to adjust its use of sunlight quickly whenever theres a flare and strengthen its particleabsorption field
	Marlene was looking from one to the other as they spoke and she finally broke in with a small note of exasperation How long are you two going to keep this up Its just to keep me sitting here I can tell that very easily
	Insigna said hastily Where will you go when youre out there
	Just around To the little river or creek or whatever it is
	Why
	Because its interesting Just flowing water in the open and you cant see the ends and you know its not being pumped back to the beginning
	But it is said Insigna by the heat of Nemesis
	That doesnt count I mean human beings arent doing it Besides I just want to stand there and watch it
	Dont drink from it said Insigna severely
	I dont intend to I can last an hour without drinking If I get hungry or thirstyor anything elseIll come back Youre making such a fuss over nothing
	Genarr smiled I suppose you want to recycle everything right here in the Dome
	Yes of course Wouldnt anyone
	Genarrs smile broadened He said You know Eugenia Im quite certain that living in Settlements has changed humanity permanently The necessity of cycling is now ingrained in us On Earth you just threw things away assuming it would recycle naturally and of course sometimes it didnt
	Genarr said Insigna youre a dreamer It may be possible for human beings to learn good habits under pressure but relieve the pressure and the bad habits are back at once Downhill is easier than uphill Its called the second law of thermodynamics and if we ever do colonize Erythro I predict that we will litter it from end to end in no time at all
	No we wont said Marlene
	Genarr said in a tone of polite inquiry Why not dear
	And Marlene said with impatient force Because we wont Now can I go out
	Genarr looked at Insigna and said We might as well let her go Eugenia We cant hold her back forever Besides for what its worth Ranay D Aubisson who just got back from Rotor went over all the records from the start and told me yesterday that Marlenes brain scan seems so stable that she is convinced that Marlene will come to no harm on Erythro
	Marlene who had turned toward the door as though ready to walk to the airlock now turned back Wait Uncle Siever I almost forgot You must be careful of Dr D Aubisson
	Why Shes an excellent neurophysicist
	Thats not what I mean She was pleased when you were in trouble after your trip outside and pretty disappointed when you got better
	Insigna looked surprised and said automatically What makes you say that
	Because I know 
	But I dont understand that Siever dont you get along with D Aubisson
	Certainly I do We get along very well Never a cross word But if Marlene says
	Mightnt Marlene be wrong Marlene said at once But Im not Genarr said Im sure youre right Marlene Then to Insigna D Aubisson is an ambitious woman If anything happens to me shes the logical choice as my successor Shes had a great deal of experience down here and shes surely the best person to deal with the Plague if it lifts its head again Whats more shes older than I am and may not feel theres much time to waste I couldnt blame her if she was anxious to succeed me and if her heart lifted a bit when I was ill The chances are shes not even consciously aware of these feelings
	Yes she is said Marlene ominously She knows all about it You watch out Uncle Siever
	Well I will Are you ready now
	Of course Im ready
	Then let me walk you to the airlock You come with us Eugenia and try not to look so tragic
	And so it was that Marlene stepped out onto the surface of Erythro alone and unprotected for the first time It was by Earth Standard time  PM January   By Erythro time it was midmorning


Thirty Transition


	Crile Fisher tried to suppress his excitement tried to maintain the same calm expressions that the others were wearing
	He didnt know where Tessa Wendel was at the moment She couldnt be far since the Superluminal was reasonably smallthough broken up so that someone in one bay might well be out of sight to someone in another
	The other three crew members were just pairs of hands to Fisher They each had something to do and they were doing it Only Fisher himself had nothing specific to do except perhaps to be careful to stay out of the way of the others
	He looked at the other three two men and one woman almost furtively He knew them to talk to and had talked to them frequently They were all young The oldest was ChaoLi Wu who was thirtyeight and a hyperspacialist Then there was Henry Jarlow who was thirtyfive and Merry Blankowitz the baby of the team twentyseven years old and with the ink still damp on her doctors diploma
	Wendel at fiftyfive was ancient by comparison but she was the inventor the designer the demigoddess of the flight
	It was Fisher who was odd man out He would be fifty on his next birthday which was not so far off and he had no specialized training He had no right to be on the ship if either youth or knowledge were considered
	But he had been on Rotor once That counted And Wendel wanted him with her and that counted even more So did Tanayama and Koropatsky which counted most of all
	The ship was making its way lumbering through space Fisher could tell that even though there was no physical indication that this was so He could feel it with the tendrils of his intestinesif they had any He thought fiercely Ive been in space far longer than all the others put together far more times on far more ships I can tell there is nothing sleek about this ship just by the feel of it They cant
	The Superluminal had to lack sleekness The normal power sources that kept ordinary spaceships moving through the vacuum were cramped and cut down in the Superluminal They had to be for most of the ship was given over to the hyperspatial motors
	It was like a seabird that waddled clumsily on land because it was designed for the water
	Wendel suddenly appeared Her hair was somewhat disheveled and she was perspiring a bit
	Fisher said Is everything all right Tessa
	Oh yes perfectly She rested her rear end against one of the convenient wall depressions very useful considering the light pseudograv maintained on the ship No problems
	When do we make the move into hyperspace
	In a few hours We want to get into the proper coordinates with all appropriate gravitational sources twisting space precisely as calculated
	So we can allow for it exactly
	Thats right
	Fisher said That doesnt make hyperspatial flight sound very practical What if you dont know where everything is What if youre in a hurry and cant wait to calculate every gravitational twitch
	Wendel looked up at Fisher with a sudden smile Youve never asked anything like this before Why do you ask it now
	Ive never actually been on a hyperspatial flight before The question presents itself to me with greater urgency under these conditions you see
	This and many other such questions have presented themselves to me with the greatest possible urgency for years Welcome to the club
	But answer me
	Gladly In the first place there are devices that measure overall gravitational intensity in both scalar and tensor aspects at any point in space whether you know the neighborhood or not The result is not quite as accurate as it would be if you painstakingly measured each gravitational source and added them together but it is close enoughif time is precious And if time is still more precious and you have to push the hyperspatial button so to speak and trust to good fortune that gravitation is not very significant and should happen to be slightly wrong then the transition would be accompanied by something roughly equivalent to a jarlike crossing a threshold and catching the toe of your shoe on the sill If we can avoid that fine but if we dont its not necessarily fatal Naturally in the first transition point we would like it to be as smooth as possible for our psychological peace of mindif nothing else
	What if youre in a hurry feel that gravitation is negligible and it isnt
	You have to hope that that doesnt happen
	You talked about strains during transition That means our very first transition might be fatal even if gravity is allowed for
	Might be but the odds against a fatal accident at any given transmission are enormous 
	Even if it isnt fatal might it not be unpleasant
	Thats harder to say because it requires a subjective judgment Understand that theres no acceleration involved In hyperassistance a ship has to work its way up to light speed and even a little beyond at intervals by use of a lowenergy hyperspatial field Efficiency is low speeds are high risks are great and frankly I dont know what the discomforts may or may not be
	In our kind of superluminal flight using a highenergy hyperspatial field we make the transition at normal speeds We may be at a speed of a thousand kilometers per second at one instant and at the next we are going a thousand million kilometers per second without acceleration And since there is no acceleration we dont feel it
	How can there be no acceleration when you increase the speed a millionfold in an instant
	Because the transition is the mathematical equivalent of acceleration However whereas your body responds to acceleration it does not to transition
	But how can you tell
	By sending animals through hyperspace from one point to another They are in hyperspace for only a brief fraction of a microsecond but its the transition between space and hyperspace that we worry about and there is one in either direction in even the briefest possible passage through hyperspace
	And animals were sent
	Of course Once they had reached the reception point they couldnt very well tell us how things were but there they were totally unhurt and calm It was clear they hadnt been harmed in any way We tried it on dozens of animals of all kinds We even tried it on monkeys all of which survived perfectlyexcept in one case
	Ah And what happened in that one case
	The animal was dead grotesquely mutilated but that was caused by a mistake in the programming It wasnt the transition at all And something like that can happen to us Its not likely but it can It would be equivalent to stepping over a threshold catching the toe of your shoe on the sill tripping falling forward and breaking your neck Such things have indeed happened but we dont expect it to happen every time we cross a threshold All right
	I guess I dont have a choice said Fisher grimly  All right Two hours and twentyseven minutes later the ship crossed safely into hyperspace with no sensation whatever for anyone on board and the first superluminal flight at speeds far beyond that of light took place
	The transition by Earth Standard time was at  PM January 


ThirtyOne Name


	Silence
	Marlene reveled in itall the more so because she could break it if she wished She stooped to pick up a pebble and tossed it against a rock It made a small thunk then fell to the ground and was still
	Having left the Dome with no more clothes than she would have worn on Rotor she felt perfectly free
	She had walked straight away from the Dome toward the creek without even watching to check the landmarks
	Her mothers last words had been a rather weak plea Please Marlene remember you said you would stay in sight of the Dome
	She had smiled briefly but had paid no attention She might stay in sight but perhaps not She did not intend to be hemmed in regardless of what promises she had been forced to make to keep the peace After all she was carrying a waveemitter At any time she could be located She herself could use the receiving end of it to sense the direction of the Domes emitter
	If she had an accident of some sortif she fell or was somehow hurtthey could come get her
	If a meteor struck herwell shed be dead There would be nothing anyone could do about that even if she were in sight of the Dome Even allowing for the disturbing thought of meteors it was all so peaceful and wonderful on Erythro On Rotor it was always noisy Wherever you went the air quivered and shook and battered your tired ears with sound waves It must be even worse on Earth with its eight billion people and trillions of animals and its thunderstorms and wild surges of water from the sea and sky She had once tried to listen to a recording entitled Noises of Earth had winced at it and had quickly had enough
	But here on Erythro there was a wonderful silence Marlene came to the creek and the water moved past her with a soft bubbly sound She picked up a jagged pebble and tossed it into the water and there was a small splash Sounds were not forbidden on Erythro they were merely doled out as occasional adornments that served to make the surrounding silence more precious
	She stamped her foot on the soft clay at the creeks edge She heard a small dull thump and there was the vague impression of a footprint She bent down cupped some water in her hand and tossed it over the soil in front of her It moistened and darkened in spots crimson showing against pink She added more water and finally placed her right shoe on the dark spot pressing down When she lifted her shoe there was a deeper footprint there
	There were occasional rocks in the creek bed and she used them as steppingstones to cross the water
	Marlene kept on walking vigorously swinging her arms taking in deep breaths of air She knew very well that the oxygen percentage was somewhat lower than it was on Rotor If she ran she would quickly grow tired but she lacked the impulse to run If she ran she would use up her world more rapidly
	She wanted to look at everything She looked back and the mound of the Dome was visible especially the bubble that housed the astronomical instruments That irritated her She wanted to be far enough away so that she could turn around and see the horizon as a perfectif irregularcircle with no intrusion of any sign of humanity except herself anywhere
	Should she call the Dome Should she tell her mother she would be out of sight for a little while No they would just argue They could receive her carrier wave They would be able to tell that she was alive well and moving around If they called her she decided she would ignore them Really They must leave her to herself
	Her eyes were adjusting to the pinkness of Nemesis and of the land around her in every direction It was not merely pink it was all in darks and lights in purples and oranges almost yellows in some places It time it would become a whole new palette of colors to her heightened senses as variegated as Rotor but more soothing
	What would happen if someday people settled on Erythro introduced life built cities Would they spoil it Or would they have learned from Earth and would they go about it in a different way taking this new untouched world and making it into something close to their hearts desire
	Whose hearts desire That was the problem Different people would have different ideas and they would quarrel with each other and pursue irreconcilable ends Would it be better to leave Erythro empty
	Would that be right when people might enjoy it so Marlene knew well that she didnt want to leave it It warmed her being on this world She didnt know quite why but it felt more like home than Rotor ever had
	Was it some dim atavistic memory of Earth Was there a feeling for a huge endless world in her genes a longing that a small artificial turning cityinspace could not fulfill How could that be Earth was surely different from Erythro in every possible way but the similarity of size And if Earth were in her genes why wouldnt it be in the genes of every human being
	But there must be some explanation Marlene shook her head as though to clear it and whirled around and around as if she were in the midst of endless space Strange that Erythro didnt seem barren On Rotor you could see acres of grain and orchards of fruit trees and a haze of green and amber and the straightline irregularity of human structures Here on Erythro however you saw only the rolling ground interspersed with rocks of all sizes as though strewn carelessly by some giant handstrange brooding silent shapes with rivulets of water here and there flowing around and among them And no life at all if you didnt count the myriads of tiny germlike cells that kept the atmosphere full of oxygen thanks to the energy supply of Nemesis red light
	And Nemesis like any red dwarf would continue to pour out its careful supply of energy for a couple of hundred billion years hoarding its energy and seeing to it that Erythro and its tiny prokaryotes were warm and comfortable through all that time Long after Earths Sun had died and other bright stars born still later had also died N emesis would shine on unchanged and Erythro would roll about Megas unchanged and the prokaryotes would live and die also essentially unchanged
	Surely human beings would have no right to come to this unchanging world and change it Yet if she were alone on Erythro she would need foodand companionship
	She might return to the Dome now and then for supplies or to refresh a need to see other people but she could still spend most of her time alone with Erythro But would not others follow How could she prevent them And with others no matter how few would not Eden inevitably be ruined Wasnt it being ruined because she herself had entered Edenonly she
	No She shouted it She shouted it loudly in a sudden eager experiment to see if she could make the alien atmosphere tremble and force it to carry words to her ears
	She heard her own voice but in the flat terrain there were no echoes Her shout was gone as soon as it sounded
	She whirled again The Dome was just a thin shadow on the horizon It could almost be ignored but not quite She wished it was not visible at all She wanted nothing in view but herself and Erythro
	She heard the faint sigh of the wind and knew it had picked up speed It was not strong enough to feel and the temperature hadnt dropped nor was it unpleasant It was just a faint  Ahhhh She imitated it cheerfully  Ahhhhh Marlene stared up at the sky curiously The weather forecasters had said it would be clear that day Was it possible for storms to blow up suddenly and unpredictably on Erythro Would the wind rise and become uncomfortable Would clouds whip across the sky and rain begin to fall before she could get back to the Dome
	That was silly as silly as the meteors Of course it rained on Erythro but right now there were only a few wispy pink clouds above They moved lazily against the dark and unobstructed sky There didnt seem to be any sign of a storm
	Ahhhhh whispered the wind Ahhhhh ayyyy
	It was a double sound and Marlene frowned What could be making that sound Surely the wind could not make the sound by itself It would have to pass some obstruction and whistle as it did so But there was nothing of the sort within sight
	Ahhhhh ayyyyy uhhhhh
	It was a triple sound now with the stress on the second sound Marlene looked around wondering She couldnt tell where it was coming from To make the sound something had to be vibrating but she saw nothing felt nothing
	Erythro looked empty and silent It could make no sound  Ahhhh ayyyy uhhhh
	Again Clearer than before It was as though it were in her own head and at that thought her heart seemed to contract and she shivered She felt the gooseflesh rise on her arms she didnt have to look
	Nothing could be wrong with her head Nothing
	She was waiting to hear it again and it came Louder Still clearer Suddenly there was a ring of authority to it as though it were practicing and growing better
	Practicing Practicing what
	And unwillingly entirely unwillingly she thought Its as though someone who cant sound consonants is trying to say my name
	As though that were a signal or her thought had released another spasm of power or had perhaps sharpened her imagination she heard
	Mahhh layyy nuhhh
	Automatically without knowing she was doing it she lifted her hands and covered her ears
	Marlene she thoughtsoundlessly
	And then came the sound mimicking Mahrlaynuh
	It came again almost easily almost naturally Marlene
	She shuddered and recognized the voice It was Aurinel Aurinel of Rotor whom she hadnt seen since the day on Rotor when she told him that the Earth would be destroyed She had thought of him hardly at all since thenbut always achingly when she did
	Why was she hearing his voice where he was notor hearing any voice where all was not
	Marlene
	And she gave up It was the Erythro Plague that she had been so certain would not touch her 
	She was running blindly blindly toward the Dome not pausing to tell where it was
	She did not know that she was screaming
	They had brought her in They had sensed her sudden approach at a run Two guards in Esuits and helmets had moved out at once and they had heard her screaming
	But the screaming had stopped before they had reached her The running had slowed and stopped too and that was before she seemed aware of their approach
	When they reached her she looked at them quietly and amazed them by asking Whats wrong
	No one had answered A hand reached out for her elbow and she whipped away
	Dont touch me she said Ill go to the Dome if thats what you want but I can walk
	And she had walked quietly back with them She was quite selfpossessed
	Eugenia Insigna lips dry and pale was trying not to seem distraught What happened out there Marlene
	Marlene said her dark eyes wide and unfathomable Nothing Nothing at all
	Dont say that You were running and screaming
	I may have been for a little while but just for a little while You see it was quiet so quiet that after a while I felt as though I must be deaf Just silence you know So I stamped my feet and ran just to hear the noise and I screamed
	Just to hear the noise of it asked Insigna frowning Yes Mother
	Do you expect me to believe that Marlene Because I dont We picked up the screams and those were not the screams of making noise Those were screams of terror Something had frightened you
	I told you The silence The possibility of deafness
	Insigna turned to D Aubisson Isnt it possible Doctor that if you dont hear anything anything at all and if youre used to hearing things all the time then your ears might just imagine theyre hearing something so they can feel useful
	D Aubisson forced a thin smile Thats a colorful way of putting it but it is true that sensory deprivation can produce hallucinations
	That disturbed me I suppose But after I heard my own voice and my own footsteps I quieted down Ask the two guards who came to get me I was perfectly calm when they arrived and I followed them into the Dome with no trouble Ask them Uncle Siever
	Genarr nodded Theyve told me this And we watched it happen besides Very well then Thats it
	Thats not it at all said Insigna her face still whitefrom fright or anger or both Shes not going out any more The experiment is finished
	No Mother said Marlene outraged
	D Aubisson raised her voice as though to forestall any angry clash of wills between mother and daughter She said The experiment is not finished Dr Insigna Whether she goes out again or not is beside the point We still have to deal with the consequences of what has happened
	What do you mean demanded Insigna
	I mean its all very well to talk about imagining voices because the ear is not accustomed to silence but surely another possible reason for imagined voices is the onset of a certain mental instability
	Insigna looked stricken
	Marlene said loudly Do you mean the Erythro Plague
	I dont mean that particularly Marlene said D Aubisson We dont have any evidence only a possibility So we need another brain scan Its for your own good
	No said Marlene
	Dont say no said D Aubisson Its a must We have no choice Its something well have to do
	Marlene looked at D Aubisson out of her dark and brooding eyes She said Youre hoping I have the Plague You want me to have the Plague
	D Aubisson stiffened and her voice cracked Thats ridiculous How dare you say such a thing
	But it was Genarr now who was staring at D Aubisson He said Ranay weve discussed this little point about Marlene and if she says you want her to have the Plague you must have given yourself away in some way That is if Marlene is serious and isnt just saying it out of fright or anger
	Im serious said Marlene She was just bubbling with hopeful excitement
	Well Ranay  said Genarr a little more coldly  Are you
	I see what the girl means said D Aubisson frowning I have not studied a fresh case of advanced Plague in years And in the days when I did when the Dome was primitive and had just been established I had had virtually no appropriate devices with which to study it Professionally I would greatly welcome a chance to make a thorough study of a case of the Plague with modern techniques and instrumentation to find out perhaps the true cause the true cure the true prevention Its a reason for excitement yes It is a professional excitement that this young woman unable to read minds and without experience in such things interprets as simple joy It isnt simple
	It may not be simple said Marlene but its malevolent Im not mistaken in that
	You are mistaken The brain scan must and will take place
	It will not  said Marlene practically shouting Youll have to force me or sedate me and then it wont be valid
	Insigna said her voice shaking I dont want anything done against her will
	This is something that goes beyond what she wills or does not will began D Aubisson and then staggered back with her hand to her abdomen
	Genarr said automatically Whats the matter
	Then without waiting for an answer leaving it to Insigna to lead D Aubisson to the nearest sofa and to persuade her to lie down he turned to Marlene and said hurriedly Marlene agree to the test
	I dont want to Shell say I have the Plague
	She wont I guarantee that Not unless you really do
	I dont
	Im sure you dont and the brain scan will prove it Trust me Marlene Please
	Marlene looked from Genarr to D Aubisson and back again  And I can go back out on Erythro again
	Of course As often as you wish If youre normaland youre sure youre normal arent you
	Sure as anything
	Then the brain scan will prove it 
	Yes but shell say I cant go out again
	Your mother
	And the doctor
	No they wont dare stop you Now just say youll allow the brain scan
	All right She can have it
	Ranay D Aubisson struggled to her feet
	D Aubisson studied the computerized analysis of the brain scan carefully while Siever Genarr watched
	A curious scan muttered D Aubisson
	We knew that to begin with said Genarr Shes a strange young woman The point is theres no change
	None said D Aubisson You sound disappointed
	Dont start that again Commander Theres a certain professional disappointment I would like to study the condition
	How do you feel
	I just told You
	I mean physically That was a strange collapse you had yesterday
	It wasnt a collapse It was nervous tension Im not often accused of wanting someone to be seriously illand of having it apparently believed 
	What happened An attack of indigestion
	Could be Abdominal pains in any case And dizziness
	Does that often happen to you Ranay
	No it doesnt she said sharply Neither am I accused of unprofessional behavior often
	Just an excitable young woman Why did you take it so seriously
	Do you mind if we change the subject She does not have any signs of brain scan change If she was normal before then she is still normal
	In that case is it your professional opinion that she may continue to explore Erythro
	Since she has not been affected apparently I have no grounds on which to forbid her
	Are you willing to go beyond that and send her out
	D Aubissons attitude grew hostile You know that Ive been to see Commissioner Pitt It did not sound like a question
	Yes I know said Genarr quietly
	He has asked me to head a new project designed to study the Erythro Plague and there will be a generous appropriation toward that study
	I think that is a good idea and that you are a thoroughly good choice to head the study
	Thank you However he did not appoint me Commander in your place Therefore it is up to you Commander to decide whether Marlene Fisher can be allowed to go out on Erythro I will confine myself to giving her a brain scan if signs of abnormality show up
	I intend to give Marlene permission to explore Erythro freely whenever she wishes May I have your concurrence in that
	Since you have my medical opinion that she does not have the Plague I will make no attempt to stop you but the order to do so will have to be yours alone If anything must be put into writing you will have to sign it yourself
	But you wont try to stop me
	I have no reason to

	Dinner was over and soft music played in the background Siever Genarr who had carefully talked of other things to an uneasy Eugenia Insigna finally said The words are the words of Ranay D Aubisson but the force behind them is that of Janus Pitt
	Insignas look of uneasiness deepened Do you really think that
	Yes I doand you should You know Janus better than I do I think Its too bad Ranay is a competent doctor has a profound mind and is a good person but shes ambitiousas we all are one way or anotherand she can therefore be corrupted She really wants to go down in history as the one who defeated the Erythro Plague
	And she would be willing to risk Marlene to do it
	Not willing in the sense that she wants to or is eager to but willing in the sense ofwell if theres no other way
	But there must be other ways To send Marlene into danger as an experimental device is monstrous
	Not from her standpoint and certainly not from Pitts One mind is well lost if it rescues a world and makes it a fit human habitation for millions Its a hardhearted way of looking at it but future generations might make a heroine out of Ranay for being hardhearted and agree with her that one mind was well lost or a thousandif thats what it would take
	Yes if its not their minds
	Of course All through history human beings have been ready to make sacrifices at the expense of other people Certainly Pitt would Or dont you agree
	About Pitt Yes I do said Insigna energetically To think that I worked with him all those years
	Then you know that he would view this in a very moralistic sense The greatest good for the greatest number he would say Ranay admits that she talked to him on her recent visit to Rotor and Im as positive that thats what he said to her in one form of words or another as that I am sitting in this chair
	And what would he say said Insigna bitterly if Marlene were exposedand destroyedand the Plague remained untouched What would he say if my daughters life were uselessly reduced to vacuity And what would Dr D Aubisson say
	The doctor would feel unhappy Im sure of that
	Because she wouldnt gain the credit for the cure
	Of course but she would also feel unhappy about Marleneand I dare say guilty Shes not a monster As for Pitt
	He is a monster
	I wouldnt even say that but he has tunnel vision He sees only his plan for the future of Rotor If anything goes wrong from our standpoint he will undoubtedly tell himself that Marlene would in any case have interfered with his plans and he will consider all to have happened for the good of Rotor It will not hang heavily on his conscience
	Insigna shook her head slightly I wish we were making a mistake that Pitt and D Aubisson were not guilty of such things
	I too wish that but I am willing to trust Marlene and her body language insights She said that Ranay was happy at the possibility that she would have a chance to study the Plague I accept Marlenes judgment in this
	D Aubisson said she was happy for professional reasons Insigna said  Actually I can believe that in a way After all Im a scientist too
	Of course you are said Genarr his homely face crinkling into a smile You were willing to leave the Solar System and go on an untried trip across the lightyears to gain astronomical knowledge even though you knew it might mean the death of every person on Rotor
	A very small chance it seemed to me
	Small enough to risk your oneyearold child You might have left her with your stayathome husband and made sure of her safety even though it would have meant you would never see her again Instead you risked her life not even for the greater good of Rotor but for the greater good of yourself
	Insigna said Stop it Siever Thats so cruel
	Im just trying to show you that almost everything can be looked at from two opposing sets of views given sufficient ingenuity Yes D Aubisson calls it professional pleasure at being able to study the disease but Marlene said the doctor was being malevolent and again I trust Marlenes choice of words
	Then I suppose said Insigna the corners of her mouth curving downward that she is anxious to have Marlene go out on Erythro again
	I suspect she does but she is cautious enough to insist that I give the order and even suggests I put it in writing She wants to make sure that it is I not she who gets the blame if something goes wrong Shes beginning to think like Pitt Our friend Janus is contagious
	In that case Siever you mustnt send Marlene out Why play into Pitts hands
	On the contrary Eugenia Its not simple at all We must send her out
	What 
	Theres no choice Eugenia And no danger to her You see I now believe you were right when you suggested there was some permeating lifeform on the planet that could exert some sort of power over us You pointed out that I was deleteriously affected and you were and the guard was and always when Marlene was in any way opposed And I just saw precisely that happen to Ranay When Ranay tried to force a brain scan on Marlene she doubled up When I persuaded Marlene to accept the brain scan Ranay immediately improved
	Well there you are then Siever If theres a malevolent lifeform on the planet
	Now wait Eugenia I didnt say it was malevolent Even if this lifeform whatever it might be caused the Plague as you suggested it did that stopped You said it was because we seemed to be content to remain in the Dome but if the lifeform were truly malevolent it would have wiped us out and it would not have settled for what seems to me to have been a civilized compromise
	I dont think its safe to try to consider the actions of a totally alien lifeform and deduce from that its emotions or intentions What it think might well be totally beyond our understanding
	I agree Eugenia but its not harming Marlene Everything it has done has served to protect Marlene to shield her from interference
	If thats so said Insigna then why was she frightened why did she begin to run to Dome screaming Not for one moment do I believe her tale that the silence made her nervous and she was just trying to make some noise to break that silence
	That is hard to believe The point is though that the panic subsided quickly By the time her wouldberescuers reached her she seem perfectly normal I would guess that something the lifeform had done had frightened MarleneI would imagine it was as unlikely to understand our emotions as we are to understand itsbut seeing what it had done it proceeded to soothe her quickly That would explain what happened and would demonstrate once again the humane nature of the lifeform
	Insigna was frowning The trouble with you Siever is that you have this terrible compulsion to think good of everyoneand everything I cant trust your interpretation
	Trust or not you will find we can in no way oppose Marlene Whatever she wants to do she will do and the opposition will be left behind gasping in pain or flatout unconscious
	Insigna said But what is this lifeform
	I dont know Eugenia
	And what frightens me more than anything now is What does it want with Marlene
	Genarr shook his head I dont know Eugenia And they stared at each other helplessly


ThirtyTwo Lost


	Crile Fisher watched the bright star thoughtfully At first it had been too bright to watch in the ordinary sense He had glanced at it every once in a while and would see a bright afterimage Tessa Wendel who was in a state of despair over developments had scolded and spoken of retinal damage so he had opacified the viewport and had brought the brightness of the star down to just bearable levels That dimmed the other stars to a downcast tarnished glitter
	The bright star was the Sun of course It was farther away than any human being had ever seen it except for the people of Rotor on their journey away from the Solar System It was twice as far away as one would see it from Pluto at its farthest so that it showed no orb and shone with the appearance of a star Nevertheless it was still a hundred times the brightness of the full Moon as seen from Earth and that hundredfold brightness was condensed and compacted into one brilliant point No wonder one still couldnt bear to turn a direct and unflinching gaze upon it through an unopacified glass
	It made things different The Sun ordinarily was nothing to wonder at It was too bright to look at too unrivaled in its position The minor portion of its light that was scattered into blueness by the atmosphere was sufficient to blank out the other stars altogether and even where the stars were not blanked out as on the Moon for instance they were so overridden by the Sun that there was no thought of comparison
	Here so far out in space the Sun had dimmed at least to the point where comparison was possible Wendel had said that from this vantage point the Sun was one hundred and sixty thousand times as bright as Sirius which was the next brightest object in the sky It was perhaps twenty million times as bright as the dimmest stars he could see by eye It made the Sun seem more marvelous by comparison than when it shone uncompared in Earths sky
	Nor did he have much more to do than watch the sky for the Superluminal was merely drifting It had been doing that for two days two days of drifting through space at mere rocket velocities
	At this speed it would take thirtyfive thousand years to reach the Neighbor Starif they had been heading in the right direction And they werent
	It was this that had turned Wendel two days earlier into a picture of whitefaced despair
	Until then there had been no trouble When they were due to enter hyperspace Fisher had tensed himself fearing the possible pain the piercing flash of agony the sudden surge of eternal darkness
	None of that had happened It had all been too fast to experience They had entered into and emerged from hyperspace in the same instant The stars had simply blinked into a different pattern with no perceptible moment in which they had lost their first pattern yet not gained their second
	It was relief in a double sense Not only was he still alive but he realized that if something had gone wrong and he had died then death would have come in such a notime way that he could not possibly have experienced death He would simply have been dead
	The relief was so keen that he was scarcely aware that Tessa had let out a gasp of disturbance and pain and dashed out to the engine room with an outcry
	She came back looking dishevelednot a hair out of place but looking internally disheveled Her eyes were wild and she stared at Fisher as though she did not really recognize him
	She said The pattern should not have changed
	Shouldnt it
	We havent moved far enough Or shouldnt have Only one and a third millilightyears That would not have been enough to alter the star pattern to the unaided eye Howevershe drew a deep shuddering breathits not as bad as it might have been I thought we had slipped and moved out thousands of lightyears
	Would that have been possible Tessa
	Of course it would have been possible If our passage through hyperspace werent tightly controlled a thousand lightyears is as easy as one
	In that case we can as easily just go
	Wendel anticipated the conclusion No we couldnt just go back If our controls were that slipshod every pass we would make would be uncontrolled travel ending at some random point and wed never find our way back
	Fisher frowned The euphoria of having passed through hyperspace and backand stayed alivebegan to leak away But when you sent out test objects you brought them back safely
	They were far less massive and were sent out through far shorter distance But as I said its not too bad It turns out we went the correct distance The stars are in the correct pattern
	But they changed I saw them change
	Because were oriented differently The long axis of the ship has veered through an angle of better than twentyeight degrees In short we followed a curved path rather than a straight one for some reason
	The stars as seen through the viewport were moving now slowly steadily
	Wendel said Were turning to face the Neighbor Star again just for the psychological value of facing in the right direction but then we must find out why we curved in passage
	The bright star the beacon star the star of brilliance entered the viewport and moved across it Fisher blinked
	Thats the Sun said Wendel answering Fishers look of astonishment
	Fisher said  Are there any reasonable explanations why the ship curved in passage If Rotor also curved who knows where they ended
	Or where we will end either Because I dont have any reasonable explanation Not right now She looked at him clearly troubled If our assumptions were correct then we should have changed position but not direction We should have moved in a straight line a Euclidean straight line despite the relativistic curve of spacetime because we werent in spacetime you see There may be a mistake in the programming of the computeror a mistake in our assumptions I hope the former That can be corrected easily
	Five hours passed Wendel came in rubbing her eyes Fisher looked up uncomfortably He had been viewing a film but had lost interest He had then watched the stars allowing the patterns to hypnotize him like anesthesia
	He said Well Tessa
	Nothing wrong with the programming Crile
	Then the assumptions must be wrong
	Yes but in what way There are an infinite number of assumptions we might make Which are correct We cant try them one after another Wed never finish and wed be hopelessly lost
	Silence fell between them for a while and then Wendel said If it had been the programming it would have been a stupid mistake We would have corrected it without learning anything but wed have been safe But now if we must go back to fundamentals we have a chance of discovering something really important but if we fail we may never find our way back
	She snatched at Fishers hand Do you understand Crile Something is wrong and if we dont find out what theres no wayexcept sheer incredible accidentthat will allow us to find our way home No matter how we try we may continue to end up in the wrong place and find ourselves steadily wronger and wronger Which means death eventually when our cycling fails or our power supply peters out or deep despair drains away our ability to live And its I whove done this to you But the real tragedy would be the loss of a dream If we dont come back theyll never know if the ship was successful at all They might conclude the transition was fatal and they might never try again
	But they must if they expect to escape from Earth
	They may give up they may sit cowering waiting for the Neighbor Star to complete its approach and pass on and dying bit by bit She looked up her eyes blinking rapidly her face looking terribly tired  And it would be the end of your dream too Crile
	Criles lips tightened and he said nothing
	Almost timidly Wendel said But for years now Crile youve had me If your daughteryour dreamis gone was I enough
	I might ask If superluminal flight is gone was I enough
	There seemed no easy answer on either side but then Wendel said Youre secondbest Crile but it has been a good secondbest Thank you
	Fisher stirred You speak for me too Tessa something I wouldnt have believed at the start If I had never had a daughter there would have only been you I almost wish
	Dont wish that Secondbest is enough
	And they held hands Quietly And gazed out at the stars
	Until Merry Blankowitz poked her face through the doorway Captain Wendel Wu has an idea He said he had it all along but was reluctant to mention it
	Wendel started to her feet Why was he reluctant
	He said he once suggested the possibility to you and you told him not to be a fool
	Did I And what has convinced him that Im never wrong Ill listen to it now and if its a good idea Ill break his neck for not forcing it on me earlier
	And she hurried out
	Fisher could only wait during the day and a half that followed They all ate together as they always did but silently Fisher did not know if any of them slept He slept only in snatches and woke to renewed despair
	How long can we go on like this he thought on the second day as he looked at the beauty of that unattainable bright dot in the sky that so brief a time ago had warmed him and lighted his way on Earth
	Sooner or later they would die Modern space technology would prolong life Recycling was quite efficient Even food would last a long time if they were willing to accept the tasteless algae cake they would end up with The microfusion motors would dribble out energy for a long time too But surely no one would want to prolong life through the full time that the ship would make possible
	With a lingering dragging hopeless lonely death finally certain the rational way out would be to use the adjustable demetabolizers
	That was the preferred method for suicide on Earth why should it not be on board ship as well You couldif you wishedadjust the dose for a full day of reasonably normal life live it out as joyously as you coulda known last day At the end of the day you would grow naturally sleepy You would yawn and release your hold on wakefulness passing into a peaceful sleep of restful dreams The sleep would slowly deepen the dreams would slowly fade and you would not wake up No kinder death had ever been invented
	And then Tessa just before  PM shiptime on the second day after the transition that had curved instead of being straight burst into the room Her eyes were wild and she was breathing hard Her dark hair which in the last year had become liberally salted with gray was mussed
	Fisher rose in consternation Bad
	No good she said throwing herself into a chair rather than sitting down
	Fisher wasnt sure he had heard correctly wasnt sure that perhaps she might only have been speaking ironically He stared at her and watched her as she visibly gathered herself together
	Good she repeated Very good Extraordinary Crile youre looking at an idiot I dont suppose Ill ever recover from this
	Well what happened
	ChaoLi Wu had the answer He had it all along He told me I remember him telling me Months ago Maybe a year ago I dismissed it I didnt even listen really She paused to catch her breath Her excitement had completely disoriented the natural rhythm of her speech
	She said The trouble was that I thought of myself as the world authority on superluminal flight and was convinced that no one could possibly tell me anything I didnt know or hadnt thought of And if someone did suggest something that seemed strange to me the idea was simply wrong and presumably idiotic Do you know what I mean
	Fisher said grimly Ive met people like that
	Everyones like that now and then said Wendel given certain conditions I suppose aging scientists are particularly like that Thats why the daring young revolutionaries of science become old fossils after a few decades Their imaginations harden with encrusted selflove and thats their end It is now my endBut enough of that It took us over a day to really work it out to adjust the equations to program the computer and set up the necessary simulations to go down blind alleys and catch ourselves It should have taken a week but we were all driving each other like maniacs
	Wendel paused here as if to catch her breath Fisher waited for her to continue nodding encouragement as he reached out to grasp her hand
	This is complex she continued Let me try to explain LookWe go from one point in space through hyperspace to another point in space in zero time But theres a path we take to do that and its a different path each time depending on the starting and ending points We dont observe the path we dont experience it we dont actually follow it in spacetime fashion It exists in a rather incomprehensible way Its what we call a virtual path I worked out that concept myself
	If you dont observe it and dont experience it how do you know its there
	Because it can be calculated by the equations we use to describe the motion through hyperspace The equations give us the path
	How can you possibly know that the equations are describing anything that has actual reality If could be justmathematics
	It could be I thought it was I ignored it It was Wu who suggested it might have significancemaybe a year agoand like a fullgrown idiot I dismissed it A virtual path I said had merely virtual existence If it couldnt be measured it was outside the realm of science I was so shortsighted I cant endure myself when I think of it
	All right Suppose the virtual path has some sort of existence What then
	In that case if the virtual path is drawn near a sizable body the ship experiences gravitational effects That was the first breathtakingly true and useful new conceptthat gravitation can make itself felt along the virtual path Wendel shook her fist angrily I saw that myself in a way but I reasoned that since a ship would be moving at many times the speed of light gravitation would have insufficient time to make itself felt to any measurable extent Travel would therefore be by my assumption in a Euclidean straight line
	But it wasnt
	Obviously not And Wu explained it Imagine that the speed of light is a zero point All speeds less than that of light would have negative magnitude and all speeds greater than that of light would have positive magnitude In the ordinary Universe we live in therefore all speeds would be negative by that mathematical convention and in fact must be negative
	Now the Universe is built on principles of symmetry If something as fundamental as speed of movement is always negative then something else just as fundamental ought to be always positive and Wu suggested that that something else was gravitation In the ordinary Universe it is always an attraction Every object with mass attracts every other object with mass
	However if something goes at a superluminal speedthat is faster than lightthen its speed is positive and the other something that was positive has to become negative At superluminal speed in other words gravitation is a repulsive force Every object with mass repels every other object with mass Wu suggested that to me a long time ago and I wouldnt listen His words just bounced off my eardrums
	Crile said But whats the difference Tessa When were going at enormous superluminal speeds and gravitational attraction doesnt have time to affect our motion neither would gravitational repulsion
	Ah thats not so Crile Thats the beauty of it That reverses too In the ordinary Universe of negative speeds the faster the speed relative to an attractive body the less gravitational attraction affects the direction of movement In the Universe of positive speeds hyperspace the faster we go relative to a repulsive body the more gravitational repulsion affects the direction of movement That makes no sense to us since were used to the situation as it exists in the ordinary Universe but once you are forced to change signs from plus to minus and vice versa you find these things falling into place
	Mathematically But how much can you trust the equations
	You match your calculations against the facts Gravitational attraction is the weakest of all the forces and so is the gravitational repulsion along the virtual paths Within the ship and within us every particle repels all other particles while we are in hyperspace but that repulsion can do nothing against the other forces that hold it together and have not changed signs However our virtual path from
	Station Four to here carried us close to Jupiter Its repulsion along the virtual hyperspatial path was just as intense as its attraction would have been along a nonvirtual spatial path
	We calculated how Jupiters gravitational repulsion would affect our path through hyperspace and that path curved exactly as it had been observed to do In other words Wus modification of my equations not only simplifies them but it makes them work 
	Fisher said And did you break Wus neck Tessa as you promised you would
	Wendel laughed remembering her threat No I didnt Actually I kissed him
	I dont blame you
	Of course its more important now than ever that we get back safely Crile This advance in superluminal flight must be reported and Wu must be properly honored He built on my work I admit but he went on to do what I might never have thought to do I mean consider the consequences
	I can see them said Fisher
	No you cant said Wendel sharply Now listen to me Rotor had no problems with gravitation because they merely skimmed the speed of lighta little below it at some times a little above it at othersso that gravitational effects whether positive or negative attractive or repulsive had immeasurably small effects on them It was our own true superluminal flights at many times the speed of light that makes it imperative to take gravitational repulsion into account My own equations are useless They will get ships through hyperspace but not in the right direction And thats not all
	I have always thought that there was a certain unavoidable danger in emerging from hyperspacethe second half of the transition What if you merge into an already existing object There would be a fantastic explosion that would destroy the ship and everything in it in a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
	Naturally were not going to end up inside a star because we know where the stars are located and can avoid them In time we might even know where a stars planets are and avoid them too But there are asteroids by the tens of thousands and comets by the tens of billions in the neighborhood of every star If we end up overlapping one of those that would still be deadly
	The only thing that would save us in the situation as I had thought it to be before today is the laws of chance Space is so huge that the chance of striking any object larger than an atom or at most a grain of dust is extraordinarily small Still given enough trips through hyperspace the overlapping of matter is a catastrophe just waiting to happen
	But under conditions as we now know them to be the chances are zero Our ship and any sizable object would repel each other and tend to move apart We are not likely to run afoul of anything deadly They would all automatically move out of our path
	Fisher scratched at his forehead Wouldnt we move out of our path too Wont that upset our course unexpectedly
	Yes but the small objects we are likely to encounter will alter our path in very limited fashion and we could easily make it upa small price to pay for safety
	Wendel took a deep breath and stretched luxuriantly I feel great What a sensation all this will make when we get back to Earth
	Fisher chuckled You know Tessa before you came in I was building a morbid picture in my head of our being irretrievably lost of our ship wandering forever with five dead bodies aboard of its being found someday by intelligent beings who would mourn the obvious space tragedy
	Well it wont happen you can count on that my dear said Wendel smiling and they embraced


ThirtyThree Mind


	Eugenia Insigna looked woebegone Have you really decided to go out again Marlene
	Mother said Marlene with weary patience you make it sound as though Ive come to this decision five minutes ago after a long period of uncertainty Ive been sure for a very long time that out there on Erythro is where I intend to be I havent changed my mind and I wont change it
	I know youre convinced that youre safe and I admit that nothing has happened to you so far but
	Marlene said I feel safe on Erythro Im drawn to it Uncle Siever understands
	Eugenia looked at her daughter as if to object once again but shook her head instead Marlenes mind was made up and she was not to be stopped
	Its warmer on Erythro this time Marlene thought just warm enough to make the breeze welcome The grayish clouds were scudding across the sky a bit more rapidly and they seemed thicker
	Rain was predicted for the next day and Marlene thought it might be nice to be out in the rain and watch what happened It should splash in the little creek and make the rocks wet and turn any soil muddy and mushy
	She had come up to a flat rock near the creek She brushed it with her hand and sat down on it carefully staring at the flowing water curling around the rocks that studded it and thinking that the rain would feel like taking a shower
	It would be like a shower coming down from the whole sky so that you couldnt step out of it A thought occurred to her Will there be trouble breathing
	No that couldnt be It rained on Earth all timefrequently anywayand she didnt hear that people drowned in it No it would be like a shower You could breathe in a shower
	The rain wouldnt be hot though and she liked hot showers She thought about it lazily It was very quiet out here and very peaceful and she could rest and there was no one to see her to watch her no one whom she had to interpret It was great not to have to interpret
	What temperature would it be The rain that is Why shouldnt it be the same comfortable temperature as Nemesis itself Of course she would get wet and it was always cold when you stepped out of a shower all wet And the rain would wet her clothes too
	But it would be silly to wear clothes in the rain You didnt wear clothes in the shower If it rained you would take off your clothes That would be the only thing that made sense
	Onlywhere did you put the clothes When you showered you put your clothes i the cleaner Here on Erythro maybe you could put them under a rock or have a little house built in which you could leave your clothes on a rainy day After all why wear clothes at all if it were raining
	Or if it were sunny
	Youd want to wear them if it were cold of course But on warm days
	But then why did people wear clothes on Rotor where it was always warm and clean They didnt at swimming poolswhich reminded Marlene that the young people with slim bodies and good shapes were the first ones off with their clothesand the last ones to put them on again
	And people like Marlene just didnt take their clothes off in public Maybe thats why people wore clothes To hide their bodies
	Why didnt minds have shapes you could show off Except that they did and then people didnt like it People liked to look at shapely bodies and turned up their noses at shapely minds Why
	But here in Erythro with no people she could take her clothes off whenever it was mild and be free of them Thered be no one to point fingers or laugh at her
	In fact she could do whatever she wanted because she had a whole comfortable world an empty world an allalone world to surround her and envelop her like a huge soft blanket enclosing her andjust silence
	She could feel herself letting go Just silence Her mind whispered it so that even that would interfere as little as possible
	Silence
	And she sat upright Silence
	But she had come out to hear the voice again And not scream this time Not be afraid Where was the voice
	As though she had called it as though she had whistled it up Marlene
	Her heart gave a little jump
	She held herself firm She mustnt make any sign of fright or disturbance She simply looked around and then said very calmly Where are you please
	It is notnecerynecessary to vivibrate the airtalk
	The voice was Aurinels but it didnt speak like Aurinel at all It sounded as though talking were difficult but as though it would get better
	It will get better said the voice
	Marlene had not said anything She did not say anything now She merely thought the words I dont have to talk I only need to think
	You only need to adjust the pattern Youre doing it
	But I hear you talk
	I am adjusting your pattern It is as though you hear me
	Marlene licked her lips gently She must not allow herself to be frightened to be anything but calm
	There is nothing of whichwhomwhat to be frightened said the voice that was not quite Aurinels voice
	She thought You hear everything dont you
	Does that bother you
	Yes it does
	Why
	I dont want you to know everything I want some thoughts to myself She tried not to think that that was how others might react to her and want to keep their feelings private but the thought Marlene knew would leak out the moment she made the effort not to think it
	But your pattern is unlike the others
	My pattern
	The pattern of your mind Others aretangledsnarled Yours issplendid
	Marlene licked her lips again and smiled When her mind was sensed it could be seen to be splendid She felt triumphant and thought with contempt of the girls who had onlyoutsides
	The voice in her mind said Is that thought private Marlene almost spoke aloud Yes it is
	I can detect a distinction I will not respond to your private thoughts
	Marlene felt herself hungering for praise Have you seen many patterns
	I have sensed many since you humans things came
	It wasnt sure of the word Marlene thought The voice made no response and Marlene was surprised The surprise had been a private sensation now that she came to think of it but she hadnt openly marked it to herself as private Private was private whether she thought of it or not perhaps The mind had said it could detect the distinction and it clearly could It showed in the pattern
	The voice didnt respond to that either She would have to ask specifically to show that it was not a private thought
	Please does it show in the pattern She didnt have to specify The voice would know what she was talking about
	It shows in the pattern Everything shows in your pattern because it is so well designed
	Marlene virtually purred She had her praise It would only be right to return the compliment But your own must be well designed too
	It is different My pattern stretches out It is simple in every spot and is only complex when taken together Yours is complex to start with There is no simplicity in it And yours is different from the others of your kind The others aresnarled It is not possible to crossreach with themto communicate A rearrangement is damaging for the pattern is fragile I didnt know My pattern is not fragile
	Is my pattern fragile
	No It adjusts itself
	You tried to communicate with others didnt you
	Yes
	The Erythro Plague There was no response The thought was private
	She closed her eyes reaching out intently with her mind trying to locate the source of the outside mind reaching her She was doing it in some way she did not understand perhaps doing it all wrong perhaps not doing it at all The mind might laugh at her clumsinessif it did such a thing as laugh
	There was no response
	Marlene thought Think something
	Inevitably the thought came back What shall I think
	It did not come from anywhere It did not come from here or there or elsewhere It came from inside her mind
	She thought angered at her own insufficiency When did you sense my mind pattern
	On the new container of human beings
	On Rotor
	On Rotor
	She was suddenly enlightened You wanted me You called me
	Yes
	Of course Why else had she so wanted to go to Erythro Why else had she been looking at Erythro so longingly that day when Aurinel came to her to say her mother was looking for her
	She clenched her teeth She must continue asking Where are you
	Everywhere 
	Are you the planet
	No
	Show yourself
	Here And suddenly the voice had a direction She was staring at the creek and she suddenly realized that while she had been communicating with the voice in her mind the creek had been the only thing she had been sensing She had not been aware of anything else around her It was as though her mind had enclosed itself in order to make it more sensitive to the one thing that had filled it
	And now the veil lifted The water was moving along the rocks bubbling over them swirling in a small eddy in a space marked off by several of those bubbles The small bubbles turned and broke even as new ones formed setting up a pattern that in essence didnt change and in fine detail was never repeated 
	Then one by one the bubbles broke noiselessly and the water was flat and featureless but still turned How could she see it turn if it were featureless
	Because it glistened very slightly in the pink light of Nemesis It turned and she could see it turn because the shimmers formed arcs that spiraled as they turned and coalesced Her eyes were caught in it slowly following the turns as they collected into the caricature of a face two dark holes for eyes a slash for a mouth
	It grew sharper as she watched fascinated And it took on definition and became a face staring up at her with empty eyes yet real enough to recognize
	It was the face of Aurinel Pampas
	Siever Genarr said thoughtfully and slowly making an effort to treat the matter calmly  And so you left at that time
	Marlene nodded The time before I left when I heard Aurinels voice This time I left when I saw Aurinels face
	I dont blame you
	Youre humoring me Uncle Siever
	What should I do Kick you Let me humor youif it pleases me The mind as you call it picked up Aurinels voice and his face from your mind obviously Those things must have been very clear in your mind How close were you to Aurinel
	She looked at him suspiciously What do you mean How close
	I dont mean anything terrible Were you friendly
	Yes Of course
	Did you have a crush on him
	Marlene paused and her lips pressed together Then she said I suppose I did
	You use the past tense Dont you any more
	Well whats the use He just thinks of me asa little girl A kid sister maybe
	Not entirely an unnatural thought under the circumstances But you still think of himwhich is why youve conjured up his voice and then his face
	What do you mean conjured up It was a real voice and a real face
	Are you sure
	Of course I am
	Have you told your mother any of this
	No Not a word
	Why not
	Oh Uncle Siever You know her I couldnt stand all thatnervousness I know Youre going to tell me its all out of love but that doesnt make it easier
	Youre willing to tell it to me Marlene and Im certainly very fond of you
	I know that Uncle Siever but youre not the excitable type You just look at things logically
	Shall I take that as a compliment
	I mean it as one
	In that case lets look at what you have found out and do it logically 
	All right Uncle Siever
	Good To begin with there is something alive on this planet
	Yes
	And its not the planet itself
	No definitely not He denied that
	But its one living thing apparently
	I get the impression that hes one living thing The trouble is Uncle Siever that what I get is not like telepathy is supposed to be Its not like reading a mind and just getting talk Its also impressions that come over you all at once like looking at a whole picture instead of at the little bits of light and darkness that make it up
	And the impression is of one living thing
	Yes
	And intelligent
	Very intelligent
	But not technological There is nothing technological that weve ever found on the planet This living thing that is not visible not apparent merely broods over the planetthinksreasonsbut doesnt do anything Is that it
	Marlene hesitated I cant quite tell but maybe youre right
	And then we came When do you suppose that it became aware that we had come
	Marlene shook her head I couldnt say
	Well dear it was aware of you while you were still on Rotor It must have become aware of intelligence invading the Nemesian System when we were still quite a way off Did you get that impression
	I dont think so Uncle Siever I think he didnt know about us until we landed on Erythro That attracted his attention and then he looked around and found Rotor
	Perhaps youre right Then it experimented with these new minds that it sensed on Erythro They were the first minds not its own that it may have ever sensed How long has it lived Marlene Any idea
	Not really Uncle Siever but the impression I got is that he has lived a long time maybe nearly as long as the planet
	Maybe In any case however long it has lived this was the first time it ever found itself immersed in many other minds far different from its own Does that sound right to you Marlene
	Yes
	So it experimented with these new minds and because it knew so little about them it damaged them That was the Erythro Plague
	Yes said Marlene with sudden animation He didnt say anything about the Plague directly but the impression was strong That original experimentation was the cause
	And when it realized that it was causing damage it stopped
	Yes thats why we dont have Erythro Plague now
	 And from that it would seem that this mind is benevolent that it has a sense of ethics we can approve of that it doesnt wish to harm other minds
	Yes said Marlene with delight Im sure of that
	But what is this lifeform Is it a spirit Something immaterial Something beyond our senses
	I cant say Uncle Siever sighed Marlene
	Genarr said Well let me repeat what it told you Stop me if Im wrong It said its pattern stretches out that it is simple in every spot and is complex only taken together that it is not fragile Am I right
	Yes you are
	And the only life we have ever found on Erythro are the prokaryotes the tiny bacterialike cells If I dont want something thats spiritual and immaterial Im stuck with those prokaryotes Is it possible that those little cells which seem separate are actually part of one worldgirdling organism The mind pattern would then be stretched out It would be simple in every spot and would be complex only when taken together And it would not be fragile for even if large sections of it were killed the world organism would scarcely be touched as a whole
	Marlene stared at Genarr You mean Ive been talking to germs
	I cant say certainly Marlene Its only a hypothesis but it fits beautifully and I cant think of anything else that would explain it as well Besides Marlene if we looked at the hundred billion cells that make up your brain each one of them taken by itself isnt really very much You are an organism in which all the brain cells are clumped together If you talk to another in which all the brain cells are separate and linked let us say by tiny radio waves is that so very different
	I dont know said Marlene obviously disturbed
	But lets ask another question one that is very important What does this lifeformwhatever it iswant with you
	Marlene looked startled He can talk to me Uncle Siever He can transfer ideas to me
	Your suggestion then is that it just wants someone to talk to Do you suppose that once we humans came it realized for the first time that it was lonely
	I dont know
	No impressions to that effect
	No
	It could destroy us Genarr was talking to himself now It could destroy us without trouble if it grew tired of you or bored with you
	No Uncle Siever
	Genarr said But it definitely hurt me when I wished to get in the way of your connection with the mind of the planet It hurt Dr D Aubisson your mother and a guard
	Yes but he hurt you all with only just enough force to stop you from interfering with me He did no further damage
	It goes to all these lengths to have you outside on the surface just so that it can talk to you and have companionship Somehow that doesnt seem to be enough of a reason
	Marlene said Perhaps the reason is something we cant understand Perhaps he has so different a mind that he couldnt explain his reason or if he did that it would make no sense to us
	But its mind is not so different that it cant converse with you It does receive ideas from you and transmit other ideas to you doesnt it You two do communicate
	Yes
	And it understands you well enough to try to make itself seem pleasant to you by taking on Aurinels voice and face
	Marlenes head bent and she fixed her eyes on the floor in front of her
	Genarr said softly So since it understands us we may be able to understand it and if so you must find out why it wants you so It could be very important to find that out for who knows what it is planning We have no way of finding out except through you Marlene
	Marlene was trembling I dont know how to do that Uncle Siever
	Just do as you have been doing The mind seems friendly to you and it may explain
	Marlene looked up and studied Genarr She said Youre afraid Uncle Siever
	Of course Were dealing with a mind far more powerful than ours It may if it decides it doesnt want us do away with us all
	I dont mean that Uncle Siever Youre afraid for me
	Genarr hesitated Are you still sure that youre safe on Erythro Marlene Are you safe talking to this mind
	Marlene rose to her feet and said almost haughtily Of course I am There is no risk He will not hurt me
	She sounded supremely confident but Genarrs heart sank What she thought scarcely counted for her mind had been adjusted by the mind of Erythro Could he trust her now he wondered
	After all why should this mind built up of prokaryotes in their trillion trillion not have an agenda of its own as for instance Pitt had And why shouldnt this mind in its anxiety to fulfill that agenda show all the duplicity of Pitt
	In short what if the mind were lying to Marlene for reasons of its own
	Was he right to send Marlene out to that mind under such conditions
	But did it matter whether he was right or not Had he a choice


ThirtyFour Close


	Perfect said Tessa Wendel Perfect perfect perfect She made a gesture as though she were nailing something to the wall firmly and hard Perfect
	Crile Fisher knew what she was talking about Twice in two different directions they had passed through hyperspace Twice Crile had watched the pattern of stars change somewhat Twice he had searched out the Sun finding it a bit dimmer the first time a bit brighter the second He was beginning to feel like an old hyperspatial knockabout
	He said The Sun isnt bothering us I take it
	Oh it is but in a perfectly calculable way so that the physical interference is a psychological pleasureif you know what I mean
	Fisher said playing the devils advocate The Suns pretty far away you know The gravitational effect must be pretty close to zero
	Certainly said Wendel but pretty close to zero isnt zero The effect is measurable Twice we passed through hyperspace with the virtual path first approaching the Sun obliquely and then receding at another angle Wu did the calculations beforehand and the path we took fit those calculations to all the decimal points we could reasonably ask The mans a genius He weaves shortcuts into the computer program in a fashion you wouldnt believe
	Im sure murmured Fisher
	So theres no question now Crile We can be at the Neighbor Star by tomorrow By todayif were really in a hurry Not very close of course We may have to coast inward toward the star for a reasonable period of time as a precautionary measure Besides we dont know the mass of the Neighbor Star with sufficient precision to take too many chances on a really close approach We dont want to be hurled off unexpectedly and have to work our way back She shook her head admiringly That Wu Im so pleased with him I cant begin to describe it
	Fisher said cautiously  Are you sure you dont feel a little annoyed
	Annoyed Why She stared at Fisher in surprise then said Do you think I ought to be jealous
	Well I dont know Is there a chance that ChaoLi Wu will get the credit for working out superluminal flightI mean the true details of itand that youll be forgotten or remembered only as a forerunner
	No not at all Crile Its nice of you to worry on my behalf but matters are secure My work is recorded in full detail The basic mathematics of superluminal flight are mine The engineering details I have also contributed to although others will get the major credit for designing the ship and should What Wu has done has been to add a correction factor to the basic equations Highly important of course and we can now see that superluminal flight wouldnt be practical without it but its just the icing on the cake The cake is still mine
	Fine If youre sure of that Im happy
	As a matter of fact Crile Im hoping Wu will now take the lead in developing superluminal flight The fact is Im past my best yearsscientifically that is Only scientifically Crile
	Fisher grinned I know that
	But scientifically I am over the hill The work Ive done has been the mining of the concepts I had when I was a graduate student Its been a matter of about twentyfive years of drawing conclusions and Ive gone about as far as I can go Whats needed are brandnew concepts entirely new thoughts a branching off into uncharted territory I cant do that any more
	Come Tessa dont underrate yourself
	Thats never been one of my faults Crile New thoughts are what we need youth for Its not just young brains that young people have its new brains Wu has a genome that has never appeared in humanity before Hes had experiences that are crucially hisno one elses He can have new thoughts Of course he bases them on what I have done before him and he owes a great deal to my teaching Hes a student of mine Crile a child of my intellect All that he does well reflects well on me Jealous of him I glory in him Whats the matter Crile You dont look happy
	Im happy if you are Tessa no matter how I look The trouble is that I have the feeling youre feeding me the theory of scientific advance Werent their cases in the history of science as in everything else where jealousy existed and where teachers detested their students for surpassing them
	Certainly I could quote you half a dozen notorious cases right off the top of my head but those are rare exceptions and the fact is that I dont feel that way right now I dont say that it isnt conceivable that I may at some time lose patience with Wu and the Universe but it isnt happening at the moment and I intend to savor this moment while itOh now what
	She pushed the Receive contact and Merry Blankowitzs young face appeared trimensionally in the transmitter
	Captain she said hesitantly Were having a discussion out here and I wonder if we can consult you
	Is something wrong with the flight
	No Captain Its just a discussion over strategy
	I see Well you neednt file in here Ill come out to the engine room
	Wendel blanked out the face
	Fisher muttered Blankowitz doesnt usually sound that serious Whats bugging them do you suppose
	Im not going to speculate Ill go out there and find out And she motioned Fisher to follow
	There were the three of them sitting in the engine room all of them with seats carefully on the floor despite the fact that they were under zerogravity at the moment They might just as well have been sitting each on a different wall but that would have detracted from the seriousness of the situation and it would have shown disrespect for the office of Captain besides There was a complex system of etiquette that had long been developed for zerogravity
	Wendel did not like zerogravity and if she had wanted to push her Captains privileges she could have insisted on the ship being in rotation at all times to produce a centrifugal effect that would have produced some feeling of gravity She knew perfectly well that computing a flight path was easier when the ship was at rest both translationally and rotationally with respect to the Universe as a whole but calculating it under constant rotational velocity didnt raise the difficulty to too high a level
	Nevertheless to insist on such motion would have been disrespectful to the person at the computer Etiquette again
	Tessa Wendel took her seat and Crile Fisher could not help but notice with a secret ingrown smile that she lurched slightly For all her Settlement background she had clearly never gotten her space legs He himself and there was another secret smileof satisfaction this time for all that he was an Earthman could move about in zerogravity as though he were born to it
	ChaoLi Wu took a deep breath He had a broad facethe type that looked like it belonged with a short body but he was taller than average when he stood up His hair was dark and perfectly straight and his eyes were markedly narrow
	He said softly Captain Wendel said What is it ChaoLi If you tell me some problem has developed in the programming I may be tempted to choke you
	No problem Captain No problem at all In fact there is such an absence of problems that it strikes me that were through and should go back to Earth I would like to suggest that
	Back to Earth Wendel had paused before she said that had taken the time to look a little stupefied Why We havent accomplished our task yet
	I think we have Captain said Wu his face growing expressionless We just didnt know what our task was to begin with We have worked out a practical system of superluminal flight and we didnt have that when we left Earth
	I know that but what of it
	And we dont have any means of communication with Earth If we go on now to the Neighbor Star and if something happens to us if something goes wrong Earth will not have practical superluminal flight and there is no telling when they will This could have a serious affect on Earths evacuation as the Neighbor Star approaches I feel that it is important that we go back and explain what weve learned
	Wendel had listened gravely I see And you Jarlow what are your views on this
	Henry Jarlow was tall and blond and dour There was a settled melancholy on his face that gave a totally wrong impression of his character and his long fingers which had nothing apparently delicate about them were magic when they worked with the interior of computers or with almost any instrument on board
	He said I think Wu makes sense frankly If we had superluminal communication wed get the information back to Earth that way and go on What would happen to us after that would be of no importance except to us As it is we cant sit on the gravitational correction
	And you Blankowitz asked Wendel quietly Merry Blankowitz stirred uneasily She was a small young woman and her long dark hair was cut straight across just over her eyebrows Between that and the delicacy of her bone structure and her quick nervous movements she looked like a miniature Cleopatra
	She said I dont really know I dont have very definite feelings about this but the men seem to have talked me into it Dont you think its important to get the information to Earth Weve worked out crucial effects on this trip and we need more and better ships with computers designed to take the gravitational correction into account Well be able to make a single transition between the Solar System and the Neighbor Star and do it under stronger gravitational intensities so that we can start closer to the Sun and end closer to the Neighbor Star and not have to spend weeks of coasting at both ends It seems to me that Earth has to know about this
	Wendel said I see The whole point seems to me to be whether it wouldnt be wise to get the information of the gravitational correction back to Earth right now Wu is that really as essential as you make it appear You didnt get the idea for the correction here on the ship It seems to me that you discussed it with me months ago She thought a moment  Almost a year ago
	We didnt really discuss it Captain You were impatient with me as I recall and wouldnt really listen
	Yes Ive admitted I was mistaken But you did write it down I told you to make up a formal report and that I would go over it when I had time She held up a hand I know I never had time to go over it and I dont even recall if I received it but I imagine Wu that you being youwould have prepared the report in some detail and with all the reasoning and mathematics anyone could want Didnt you do that Wu and isnt that report in the records
	Wus lips seemed to tighten but his tone of voice did not alter in any way Yes I prepared the report but it was just speculation and I dont suppose anyone else will pay any attention to itany more than you did Captain
	Why not Not everyone is as stupid as I am Wu
	Even if they paid attention it would still be nothing more than speculation When we go back we will be able to present proof
	Once the speculation exists someone will get the proof You know how science works
	Wu said in a slow and significant tone Someone
	Now we have the nature of your concern Wu Youre not worried that Earth wont obtain a practical method of superluminal flight You are worried that they will but that the credit will not be yours Isnt that right
	Captain theres nothing wrong with that A scientist has every right to be concerned over matters of priority
	Wendel positively smoldered Have you forgotten that I am the Captain of this ship and make the decisions
	I havent forgotten that said Wu but this is not a sailing vessel of the eighteenth century We are all scientists primarily and we must make decisions in some sort of democratic fashion If the majority wishes to return
	Wait said Fisher sharply before this continues do you mind if I say something Im the only one who hasnt spoken and if were going to be democratic I would like to take my turn on the floor May I Captain
	Go ahead said Wendel her right hand clenching and unclenching as though it just longed to grab someone by the throat
	Fisher said Just about seven and a half centuries ago Christopher Columbus sailed westward from Spain and eventually discovered America though he himself never knew that that was what he had done En route he made the discovery that the deviation of the magnetic compass from the true north the socalled magnetic declination changed with longitude This was an important finding and was in fact the first purely scientific discovery made in the course of a sea voyage
	Now how many know that Columbus discovered the variation of magnetic declination Virtually no one How many know that Columbus discovered America Virtually everyone So suppose that Columbus on discovering the variation decided midway to go home and make the glad announcement to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella preserving his priority as the discoverer of the phenomenon That discovery might conceivably have been greeted with interest and the monarchs might eventually have sent out another expedition headed let us say by Amerigo Vespucci who would then have reached America In that case who would remember that Columbus had made some sort of discovery about the compass Virtually no one Who would remember that Vespucci had discovered America Virtually everyone
	So do you really want to go back The discovery of the gravitational correction will I assure you be remembered by a few as a small side effect of superluminal travel But the crew of the next expedition that will actually reach the Neighbor Star will be hailed as the first to reach a star by superluminal flight You three even you Wu will scarcely be worth a footnote
	You might think that as a reward for this great discovery that Wu has made it will be you that will be sent out on a second expedition but Im afraid not You see Igor Koropatsky who is the Director of the Terrestrial Board of Inquiry and who is waiting for us back on Earth is particularly interested in information on the Neighbor Star and its planetary system He will explode like Krakatoa when he finds out that we were within reach of it and turned back And of course Captain Wendel will be forced to explain that you three had mutinied which is an extremely serious offense even if we are not an eighteenthcentury sailing vessel Far from going out on the next expedition you will never see the inside of a laboratory again Count on it What you may see despite your scientific eminence is the inside of a jail Dont underestimate Koropatskys fury
	So think about it you three On to the Neighbor Star Or back home
	There was a silence For a while no one said anything
	Well said Wendel harshly I think that Fisher has explained the situation very clearly Doesnt anyone have anything to say
	Blankowitz said in a low voice  Actually I never thought it through I think we ought to go on
	Jarlow grunted I think so too
	Wendel said What about you ChaoLi Wu
	Wu shrugged I wouldnt stand against the rest
	Im glad to hear that This incident is forgotten as far as the Earth authorities will be concerned but there had better be no repetition no further action of any kind that could be considered mutinous
	Back in their ownquarters Fisher said You dont mind I hope that I interfered I was afraid you would explode to no effect
	No it was good I wouldnt have thought of the Columbus analogy which was perfect Thank you Crile She took his hand and squeezed it
	He smiled briefly I had to justify my presence on board ship somehow
	You more than justified it And you have no idea how disgusted I was to have Wu act as he did when I had just finished telling you how happy I was over his findings and over the credit he would get I was feeling noble over my willingness to share credit over the ethics of scientific research that gives to each his fair due and then he puts his private pride ahead of the project
	Were all human Tessa
	I know And seeing that the mans interior has its ethical dark spots doesnt alter the fact that he has a scientific mind that is fearfully sharp
	Im afraid Id have to admit that my own arguments were based on private desires rather than the public good so to speak I want to go to the Neighbor Star for reasons that have nothing to do with the project
	I understand that I am still grateful It embarrassed Fisher that there were tears in her eyes and that she had to blink them away
	He kissed her
	It was just a star too faint yet to stand out in any way In fact Crile Fisher would have lost it were it not for the fact that he had punched in the network that zeroed in on it in concentric circles and radii
	It looks disappointingly like a star doesnt it said Fisher his face taking on the moroseness it seemed to have when he let it fall into its natural lines
	Merry Blankowitz who was the only one with him at the observation panel said Thats all it is Crile A star
	I mean it looks like a faint starand were so close
	Close in a manner of speaking Were still a tenth of a lightyear away which is not really close Its just that the Captains cautious Id have dragged the Superluminal in a lot closer I wish we were a lot closer right now I can hardly wait
	Before this last transition you were set to go home Merry
	Not really They just talked me into it Once you made your little speech I felt like a complete jackass I took it for granted that if we returned wed all go back a second time but of course you really clarified the situation Oh but I want to use the ND so badly
	Fisher knew what the ND was It was the neuronic detector He felt the stirring himself To detect intelligence would be to know they had come upon something that was infinitely more important than all metals rocks ices and vapors they could otherwise discover
	He said hesitantly Can you tell at this distance
	She shook her head No Wed have to be a lot closer And we cant just coast in from this distance It would take us about a year Once the Captain is satisfied with what we can find out about the Neighbor Star from here well make another transition What I expect is that in two days at the most well be within a couple of astronomic units of the Neighbor Star and then I can start making observations and be useful Its a drag feeling like a deadweight
	Yes said Fisher dryly I know
	A look of concern crossed Blankowitzs face Im sorry Crile I wasnt referring to you
	You might as well have been I might not be of any use no matter how close we come to the Neighbor Star
	You will be useful if we detect intelligence Youll be able to talk to them Youre a Rotorian and well need that
	Fisher smiled grimly A Rotorian for just a few years
	Thats enough isnt it
	Well see He changed the subject deliberately Are you sure the neuronic detector will work
	Absolutely sure We could follow any Settlement in orbit just by its radiation of plexons
	What are plexons Merry
	Just a name I made up for the photoncomplex characteristic of mammalian brains We could detect horses you know if were not too far away but we can detect human brains in masses at astronomic distances
	Why plexons
	From complexity Somedayyoull seesomeday theyre going to be working on plexons not just to detect life but to study the intimate functioning of the brain Ive made up a name for that tooplexophysiology Or maybe plexoneuronics 
	Fisher said Do you consider names important
	Yes indeed It gives you a way of speaking concisely You dont have to say that field of science that involves the relationship of this and that You just say plexoneuronicsyes that sounds better Its a shortcut It saves your thinking time for more important subjects Besides She hesitated
	Besides Yes The words came in a rush If I make up a name and it sticks that alone would get me a footnote in the history of science You know The word plexon was first introduced by Merrilee Augina Blankowitz in  on the occasion of the pioneer fasterthanlight flight of the Superluminal  Im not likely to be mentioned anywhere else or for any other reason and Ill settle for that
	Fisher said What if you detect your plexons Merry and there are no human beings present
	You mean alien life That would be even more exciting than detecting people But theres not much chance really Weve been disappointed over and over again We thought there might be at least primitive forms of life on the Moon on Mars on Callisto on Titan It never came to anything People have speculated on all kinds of weird lifeliving galaxies living dust clouds life on the surface of a neutron star all sorts of things Theres no evidence for any of it No if I detect anything it will be human life Im convinced of that
	Wouldnt you be detecting the plexons emitted by the five people on the ship Wouldnt we drown out anything we can spot at millions of kilometers of distance
	That is a complication Crile We have to balance the ND so that we five are canceled out and it has to be delicately done Even a little leakage would wipe out anything we could detect elsewhere Someday Crile automated NDs will be sent through hyperspace to all sorts of places to detect plexons Therell be no human beings in their vicinity and that alone would make them at least a couple of orders of magnitude more sensitive than anything we can do now with ourselves hanging around and having to be allowed for Well find out where intelligence exists long before we approach anyplace ourselves
	ChaoLi Wu made his appearance He looked at Fisher with a touch of distaste and said indifferently Hows the Neighbor Star
	Blankowitz said Nothing much at this distance
	Well well probably be making another transition tomorrow or the next day and then well see
	Blankowitz said It will be exciting wont it
	Wu said It will beif we find the Rotorians He glanced at Fisher But will we
	If that were a question directed to Fisher he did not respond to it He merely stared at Wu expressionlessly
	Will we Fisher thought
	The long wait would be over soon


ThirtyFive Converging


	As noted before Janus Pitt did not often allow himself the luxury of selfpity In anyone else he would consider such a thing a despicable sign of weakness and selfindulgence There were however times when he sadly rebelled at the fact that the people of Rotor were only too willing to leave all of the unpleasant decisions to him
	There was a Council yesduly elected and meticulously involved in passing laws and in making decisionsall but the important ones the ones that dealt with the future of Rotor
	That was left to him It was not even consciously left to him The matters of importance were simply ignored simply rendered nonexistent by mutual unspoken agreement
	Here they were in an empty system leisurely building new Settlements absently convinced that time stretched infinitely before them Everywhere was the calm assumption that once they had filled this new asteroid belt generations from now and a matter of no immediate concern to anyone presently alive the hyperassistance technique would have improved to the point where it would be comparatively easy to seek out and occupy new planets
	Time existed in plenty Time blended into eternity
	Only to Pitt himself was it left to consider the fact that time was short that at any given moment without warning time might come to an end
	When would Nemesis be discovered back in the Solar System When would some Settlement decide to follow Rotors lead
	It had to come someday With Nemesis inexorably moving in the direction of the Sun it would eventually reach that pointstill far distant of course but close enoughat which the people of the Solar System would have to be blind not to see it
	Pitts computer with the aid of a programmer who was convinced he was working out a problem of academic interest only had estimated that by the end of a thousand years the discovery of Nemesis would be inevitable and that the Settlements would begin to disperse
	Pitt had then put the question Would the Settlements come to Nemesis
	The answer was no By that time hyperassistance would be far more efficient far cheaper The Settlements would know more about the nearer starswhich of them had planets and what kind They would not bother with a red dwarf star but would head out for the Sunlike stars
	And that would leave Earth itself which would be desperate Afraid of space clearly degenerate already and sinking farther into slime and misery as a thousand years passed and the doom of Nemesis became apparent what would they do They could not undertake long trips They were Earthpeople Surfacebound They would have to wait for Nemesis to get reasonably close They could not hope to go anywhere else
	Pitt had the vision of a ramshackle world trying to find security in the more tightly held system of Nemesis trying to find refuge in a star with a system built tightly enough together to hold in place while it was destroying that of the Sun it passed
	It was a terrible scenario and yet inevitable
	Why could not Nemesis have been receding from the Sun How everything would be changed The discovery of Nemesis would have become somewhat less likely with time and if the discovery came to pass Nemesis would become ever less desirableand less possibleas a place of refuge If it were receding Earth would not even need a refuge
	But that was not the way it was The Earthmen would come ragtag degenerating Earthmen of every variety of makeshift and abnormal culture flooding in What could the Rotorians do but destroy them while they were still in space But would they have a Janus Pitt to show them that there was no choice but that Would they have Janus Pitts between now and then to make sure that Rotor had the weapons and the resolution to prepare for this and to do it when the time came
	But the computers analysis was after all a deceitfully optimistic one The discovery of N emesis by the Solar System must come about within a thousand years said the computer But how much within What if the discovery came tomorrow What if it had come three years ago Might some Settlement groping for the nearest star knowing nothing useful about farther ones be following in Rotors trail now 
	Each day Pitt woke up wondering Is this the day Why was this misery reserved for him Why did everyone else sleep quietly in the lap of eternity while only he himself was left to deal each day with the possibility of a kind of doom
	He had done something about it of course He had set up a Scanning Service throughout the asteroid belt a body whose function it was to supervise the automated receptors that constantly swept the sky and to detect at as great a distance as possible the copious wasteenergy disposal of an approaching Settlement
	It had taken some time to set it all up properly but for a dozen years now every scrap of dubious information had been followed up and every once in a while something seemed sufficiently questionable to be referred to Pitt And every time it happened it set off the clanging of an alarm bell in Pitts head
	It turned out always to be nothingso farand the initial relief was always followed by a kind of rage against the Scanners If anything was uncertain they washed their hands of it let it go turned it over to Pitt Let him deal with it let him suffer let him make the hard decisions
	It was at this point that Pitts selfpity became lachrymose and he would begin to stir uneasily at the possibility that he might be showing weakness
	There was this one for instance Pitt fingered the report that his computer had uncoded and that had inspired this mental selfpitying survey of his own continuous unbearable and underappreciated service to the Rotorian people
	This was the first report that had been referred to him in four months and it seemed to him that it was of minimal importance A suspicious energy source was approaching but allowing for its probable distance it was an unusually small sourcea smaller source by some four orders of magnitude than one would expect of a Settlement It was a source so small that it was all but inseparable from noise
	They might have spared him this The report that it was of a peculiar wavelength pattern that seemed to make it of human origin was ridiculous How could they tell anything about a source so weakexcept that it was not a Settlement and therefore could not be of human origin whatever the wavelength pattern
	Those idiot Scanners must not annoy me in this fashion thought Pitt
	He tossed the report aside petulantly and picked up the latest report from Ranay D Aubisson That girl Marlene did not have the Plague even yet She madly persisted in putting herself in danger in more and more elaborate waysand yet remained unharmed
	Pitt sighed Perhaps it didnt matter The girl seemed to want to remain on Erythro and if she remained that might be as good as having her come down with the Plague In fact it would force Eugenia Insigna to stay on Erythro too and he would be rid of both of them To be sure he would feel safer if D Aubisson rather than Genarr were in charge of the Dome and could oversee both mother and daughter That would have to be arranged in the near future in some way that would not make Genarr a martyr
	Would it be safe to make him Commissioner of New Rotor That would certainly rate as a promotion and he would be unlikely to refuse the position especially since in theory it would place him on an even rank with Pitt himself Or would that give Genarr a bit too much of the reality of power in addition to the appearance Was there an alternative
	He would have to think of it
	Ridiculous How much easier it would all have been if that girl Marlene had only done something as simple as getting the Plague
	In a spasm of irritation at Marlenes refusal to do so he picked up the report on the energy source again
	Look at that A little puff of energy and they bothered him with it He wasnt going to stand for it He punched a memo into the computer for instant transmission He was not to be bothered by minutiae Keep an eye out for a Settlement
	Onboard the Superluminal the discoveries came like a series of hammer blows one after the other
	They were still at a great distance from the Neighbor Star when it became apparent that it possessed a planet
	A planet said Crile Fisher with tense triumph I knew
	No said Tessa Wendel hastily its not what you think Get it through your head Crile that there are planets and planets Virtually every star has some sort of planetary system or other After all more than half the stars in the Galaxy are multiplestar systems and planets are just stars that are too small to be stars you see This planet we see isnt habitable If it were habitable we wouldnt see it at this distance especially in the dim light of the Neighbor Star
	You mean its a gas giant
	Of course it is I would have been more surprised if there hadnt been one than at finding out that one exists
	But if theres a large planet there may be small planets too
	Maybe conceded Wendel but scarcely habitable ones Theyll either be too cold for life or their rotation will be locked and theyll be showing only one side to the star which would make it too warm on one side and too cold on the other All that Rotor could doif it were herewould be to place itself in orbit around the star or possibly around the gas giant
	That might be exactly what theyve done
	For all these years Wendel shrugged Its conceivable I suppose but you cant count on it Crile
	The next blows were more startling ones
	A satellite said Tessa Wendel Well why not Jupiter has four sizable ones Why should it be surprising that this gas giant has one
	Its not a satellite like any that exists in the Solar System Captain said Henry Jarlow Its roughly the size of Earthfrom the measurements Ive been able to make
	Well said Wendel maintaining her indifference what follows from that
	Nothing necessarily said Jarlow but the satellite shows peculiar characteristics I wish I were an astronomer
	At the moment said Wendel I wish someone on the ship was but please go on Youre not completely ignorant of astronomy
	The point is that since it revolves around the gas giant it shows one face only to the gas giant which means that all sides of it face the Neighbor Star in the course of its revolution around the gas giant And the nature of the orbit is such that as near as I can tell the temperature of the world is in the liquid water stage And it has an atmosphere Now I dont have all the subtleties at my fingertips As I said Im not an astronomer Still it seems to me that theres a good chance that the satellite is a habitable world
	Crile Fisher received the news with a wide smile He said Im not surprised Igor Koropatsky predicted the existence of a habitable planet He did it without any data on the subject It was just a matter of deduction
	Did Koropatsky do that And when did he talk to you I wonder
	Sometime before we left He reasoned that nothing was likely to have happened to Rotor on the way to the Neighbor Star and since they didnt return that they must have found a planet to colonize And there it is
	And just why did he tell you this Crile
	Crile paused and considered then said He was interested in making certain that the planet would be explored for possible future use by Earth when the time came for our old planet to be evacuated
	And why do you suppose he didnt tell me this Do you have any idea
	I suppose Tessa said Crile carefully that he thought I would be the more impressionable of the two of us more eager to urge that the planet be explored
	Because of your daughter
	He knew of the situation Tessa
	And why didnt you tell me this
	I wasnt sure there was anything to tell I felt that I might as well wait and see if Koropatsky was right Since he was I am now telling you The planet must be habitable by his reasoning
	Its a satellite said Wendel obviously in a temper  A distinction without a difference
	Wendel said Look Crile No one seems to be considering my position in all this Koropatsky fills you full of nonsense in order to have us explore this system and then presumably return to Earth with the news Wu was anxious to have us return with news even before we reached this system You are anxious for a reunion with your family regardless of any wider considerations In all this there seems to be very little thought given to the fact that Im the Captain and that I will make the decisions
	Fishers voice grew cajoling Be reasonable Tessa What decisions are there to make What are your choices You say Koropatsky filled me with nonsense but he didnt Theres the planet Or the satelliteif you prefer It must be explored Its existence may mean life for Earth This may be humanitys future home In fact some of humanity may be there already
	You be reasonable Crile A world can be the right size and temperature and still be uninhabitable for any of a variety of reasons After all suppose it has a poisonous atmosphere or is incredibly volcanic or has a high level of radioactivity It has only a red dwarf star to light and warm it and it is in the immediate neighborhood of a large gas giant That is not a normal environment for an Earthtype world and how will such an abnormal environment affect it
	It must still be explored even if only to find out certainly that it is uninhabitable
	For that it may not be necessary to land said Wendel grimly Well get closer and judge better Try Crile please try not to outrun the data I couldnt bear your disappointment
	Fisher nodded Ill tryYet Koropatsky deduced a habitable planet when everyone else told me it was totally impossible You did too Tessa Over and over But there it is and it may be habitable So let me hope while I can Perhaps the people of Rotor are now on that world and perhaps my daughter is too
	ChaoLi Wu said rather indifferently The Captain is really furious The last thing she wanted was to find a planet herea world I mean since she wont allow us to call it a planetthat may be habitable It means it will have to be explored and well just have to go back and report You know thats not what she wants This is her one and only chance to be out in deep space Once this is over shes through for life Others will work on superluminal techniques others will explore space Shell be retired to an advisory position only Shell hate it
	How about you ChaoLi Would you go out in space again given a chance Blankowitz asked
	Wu didnt hesitate Im not sure that I want to go wandering around in space I dont have the exploring bug But you knowLast night I got the queer notion I might just like to settle down hereif its habitable How about you
	Settle down here Of course not I dont say Id like to be Earthbound forever but Id like to be back there for a while anyway before striking out again
	Ive been thinking about it This satellite is one inwhat Ten thousand Who would figure on a habitable world in a red dwarf system It should be explored Im even willing to spend time on it and have someone else go back to Earth and take care of my priority on the gravitational effect Youd protect my interests wouldnt you Merry
	Of course I would ChaoLi And so would Captain Wendel She has all the data signed and witnessed
	So there you are And I think the Captain is wrong to want to explore the Galaxy She could visit a hundred stars and not see one world as unusual as this one Why bother with quantity when youve got quality right in hand
	Personally  said Blankowitz I think that what bothers her is Fishers kid What if he finds her
	So what He can take her back to Earth with him What would that be to the Captain
	Theres a wife involved too you know
	Do you ever hear him mention her
	That wouldnt mean he
	Her mouth closed suddenly at the sound outside and Crile Fisher walked in and nodded at the two
	Blankowitz said quickly as though to wipe out the previous conversation Has Henry finished with the spectroscopy
	Fisher shook his head I cant tell The poor fellow is nervous Hes afraid of misinterpreting the thing I suppose
	Wu said Come on Its the computer that does the interpretation He can hide behind that
	No he cant said Blankowitz with fervor I like that You theoreticians think that all we observers do is just tend a computer give it a stroke or two and say Nice doggie then read off the results Its not so What the computer says depends on what you put into it and I never heard a theoretician face an observation he didnt like without blaming the observer Never once did I hear him say There must be something wrong with the compu 
	Hold on said Wu Lets not flood this place with recrimination Have you ever heard me blaming observers
	If you didnt like Henrys observations
	Id take them anyway I dont have any theories about this world
	And thats why youd take whatever he gives you
	At this point Henry Jarlow walked in with Tessa Wendel close behind He looked like a cloud making up its mind to rain
	Wendel said Very well Jarlow were all here Now tell us What does it look like
	The trouble is said Jarlow there isnt enough ultraviolet in the light of this weakling star to raise a sunburn on an albino I have to work with microwaves and that tells me at once that theres water vapor in the worlds atmosphere
	Wendel shrugged it off with an impatient lift of her shoulders We dont need you to tell us that A world the size of Earth in a liquidwater range of temperature would surely have water and therefore water vapor That moves it one more notch toward habitability but only one more thoroughly expected notch
	Oh no said Jarlow uneasily Its habitable No question
	Because of the water vapor
	No I have something better than that
	What
	Jarlow looked around him at the other four rather grimly and said Would you say a world was habitable if in actual fact it was inhabited
	Yes I think I could bring myself to say that said Wu calmly
	Are you telling me that you can see that its inhabited at this distance asked Wendel sharply
	Yes thats exactly what Im saying Captain Theres free oxygen in the atmosphereand in quantity Can you tell me how that can be without photosynthesis And can you tell me how you can have photosynthesis without the presence of life And can you tell me how a planet can be uninhabitable if it has oxygenproducing life on it
	There was dead silence for a moment then Wendel said That is so unlikely Jarlow Are you sure you didnt mess up the programming
	And Blankowitz quietly raised her eyebrows at Wu in an unspoken Seeeeee
	Jarlow said stiffly I have never messed up as you call it a programming in my life but of course Im willing to stand corrected if anyone here feels he is more knowledgeable about atmospheric infrared analysis than I am Its not my field of expertise but I did make careful use of Blanc and Nkrumah on the subject
	Crile Fisher who had gained considerable selfconfidence since the incident involving Wus bid to return home did not hesitate to insert his views
	Look he said this will either be confirmed or denied as we get closer but why dont we assume that Dr Jarlows analysis is correct and see where that takes us If there is oxygen in the atmosphere of this world might we not assume that its been terraformed
	All eyes turned to look at him
	Terraformed said Jarlow blankly
	Yes terraformed Why not You have this world that is suitable for life except that it has the carbon dioxide and nitrogen atmosphere that worlds without life havelike Mars and Venusand you dump algae into the ocean and pretty soon its Goodbye carbon dioxide and Hello oxygen Or maybe you do something else Im no expert
	They were still looking at him
	Fisher went on The reason Im suggesting this is that I remember there was talk about terraforming on the farms on Rotor I worked there There were even some seminars on terraforming that I attended because I felt it might have something to do with the hyperassistance program It didnt but at least I heard about terraforming
	Finally Jarlow said In all you heard about terraforming Fisher do you by any chance recall anyone saying how long it would take
	Fisher spread his arms You tell me Dr Jarlow It will save time Im sure
	All right It took Rotor two years to get hereif it got here That means its been here thirteen years If all of Rotor were solid algae and it was all dumped into the ocean and lived and grew and produced oxygen then to get to the present level where I estimate the oxygen content is  percent and carbon dioxide is present only in traces I would imagine it would take some thousands of years Perhaps hundreds of yearsif conditions were enormously favorable It certainly would take more than thirteen years And frankly Earth algae are adapted to Earth conditions quite precisely On another world the algae might not grow or might do so very slowly till it adapted itself Thirteen years wouldnt change a thing
	Fisher seemed unperturbed  Ah but there is lots of oxygen there and no carbon dioxide so if its not the result of Rotorian action what is it the result of Doesnt it strike you that we must assume theres nonEarthly life on this world
	Its what I did assume said Jarlow Wendel said Its what we have to assume immediately Native vegetation is photosynthesizing It doesnt mean for one moment that Rotorians are on the world or that they ever even reached this system
	Fisher looked annoyed Well Captain he said with pointed formality I have to say that neither does it mean that Rotorians arent on the world or that they havent reach the system If the planet has vegetation of its own it just means that no terra forming was required and the Rotorians could move right in
	I dont know said Blankowitz I should think there would be no reasonable chance at all that vegetation evolving on a strange planet would be nourishing to human beings I doubt that human beings could digest it or that they could assimilate even if they could digest it I would certainly offer high odds that it would be poisonous And if theres plant life theres bound to be animal life and we dont know what that would entail
	Even in that case said Fisher its still possible that the Rotorians would fence off a tract of land kill the native life within it and seed plants of their own I imagine this alien plantingif you want to call it thatwould expand with the years
	Supposition on supposition muttered Wendel
	In any case said Fisher its completely useless to sit here and make up scenarios when the logical thing is to explore the world as best we canand from as close a view as possible Even from its surfaceif that seems feasible
	And Wu said with surprising force I completely agree Blankowitz said Im a biophysicist and if theres life on the planet then whatever else it may have or may not have we must explore it
	Wendel looked from one to the other and reddening slightly said I suppose we must
	The closer we get said Tessa Wendel and the more information we gather the more confusing it all is Is there any question that this is apparently a dead world There is no illumination on the night hemisphere there are no signs of vegetation or of any form of life
	No gross signs said Wu coolly but something must be happening to keep oxygen in the air Not being a chemist I cant think of any chemical process that would do the trick Can anyone
	He scarcely waited for an answer In fact he went on I seriously question whether a chemist could come up with a chemical explanation If the oxygen is there it must be a biological process that produces it We just dont know of anything else
	Wendel said If we say that then were judging from our experience with exactly one oxygencontaining atmosphereEarths Someday we may be laughed at It may turn out that the Galaxy is littered with oxygen atmospheres that have no connection with life and well be on record as having been stymied entirely because of our experience with the one planet that is a freak and has a biological source of the oxygen
	No said Jarlow angrily You cant get out of it that way Captain You can picture all sorts of scenarios but you cant expect the laws of nature to change for your convenience If you want to have a nonbiological source of an oxygencontaining atmosphere you have to suggest a mechanism
	But said Wendel theres no sign of chlorophyll in the light reflected from the world
	Why should there be said Jarlow The chances are that a somewhat different molecule has been evolved under the selective pressure of light from a red dwarf star May I make a suggestion
	Please do said Wendel bitterly It seems to me you do nothing else
	Very well All we can actually tell is that the land areas of the world seem to be completely denuded of life That means nothing Until four hundred million years ago Earths land areas were similarly sterile but the planet had an oxygen atmosphere and abundant life
	Sea life
	Yes Captain Theres nothing wrong with sea life And that would include algae or the equivalentmicroscopic plants that would do perfectly well as oxygen factories The algae in Earths seas produce  percent of the oxygen that pours into the atmosphere each year Doesnt this explain everything It explains the oxygen atmosphere and it also explains the apparent lack of land life It also means we can safely explore the planet by landing on the sterile land surface of the world and studying the sea with what instruments we haveleaving it for a later expedition suitably equipped to do the detailed work
	Yes but human beings are land animals If Rotor had reached this system they would surely have attempted to colonize the land areas and of such colonization there is no hint Is it really necessary to investigate the world further the Captain asked
	Oh yes said Wu quickly We cant go back with deductions only We need some facts There may be surprises
	Do you expect any asked Wendel with a touch of anger
	It doesnt matter whether I do or not Can we go back to Earth and tell them thatwithout lookingwe were sure there would be no surprises That would not be very sensible
	It seems to me said Wendel that youve changed your mind rather drastically You were ready to return without even approaching the Neighbor Star
	As I recall said Wu I had my mind changed for me In any case under the circumstances we must explore I know Captain that there is a certain temptation to seize the opportunity to visit a few other star systems but now that there is an apparently habitable world in view we must come back to Earth with maximum information on something that may be far more important to our planet in a very practical sense than any amount of cataloguetype information concerning the nearer stars Besidesand he pointed at the viewport with what was almost surprise on his face I want to take a closer look at that world I have this feeling it will be completely safe
	This feeling said Wendel sardonically Im allowed my intuitions Captain
	Merry Blankowitz said in a rather husky voice I have my intuitions too Captain and Im worried
	Wendel looked at the young woman with sudden surprise She said Are you weeping Blankowitz
	No not really Captain Im just very upset
	Why
	Ive been using the NO
	The neuronic detector On that empty world Why
	Blankowitz said Because I came here to use it Because thats my function
	And the results are negative said Wendel Im sorry Blankowitz but if we visit other star systems youll have other chances
	But that just it Captain The results are not negative I detect intelligence on the world and thats why Im upset Its a ridiculous result and I dont know whats wrong
	Jarlow said Perhaps the device isnt working Its so new that it wouldnt be surprising if it werent reliable
	But why isnt it working Is the neuronic detector detecting us here on the ship Or is it simply giving a false positive Ive checked it The shielding is in perfect order and if I had a false positive I ought to have it elsewhere There are no signs of any positive responses from the gas giant for instance or from the Neighbor Star or from random points in space but every time I allow it to sweep the satellite I get a response
	You mean said Wendel that on this world where we can detect no life you detect intelligence
	Its a very minimal response I can just barely pick it up
	Crile Fisher said  Actually Captain what about Jarlows point If theres life in the worlds ocean and we dont detect it because the waters opaque there might still be intelligent life and perhaps Or Blankowitz detects that 
	Wu said Fisher has a good point After all life in the seahowever intelligentis not likely to have a technology You cant have fire in the sea Nontechnological life does not make itself very evident but it may still be intelligent And a species however intelligent is not to be feared without technology especially if it cant leave the sea and if we remain on land It just makes things more interesting and makes it more necessary for us to investigate
	Blankowitz said in annoyance You all talk so quickly and so endlessly that I dont get a chance to say anything Youre all wrong If it were intelligent sea life I would get a positive response only from the oceans I get it everywhere just about evenly Land as well as sea I dont understand it at all
	On land as well said Wendel clearly incredulous Then there must be something wrong
	But I cant find anything wrong said Blankowitz Thats whats so upsetting I just dont understand this Then as though in extenuation she added Its very feeble of course but its there
	Fisher said I think I can explain it All eyes turned to him and he grew immediately defensive Maybe Im not a scientist he said but that doesnt mean I cant see something thats pretty plain Theres intelligence in the sea but we cant see it because the water hides it All right that makes sense But theres intelligence on land too Well thats hidden also Its underground
	Underground said Jarlow explosively Why should it be underground Theres nothing wrong with the air or with the temperature or with anything we can detect Whats here to hide from
	From the light for one thing said Fisher forcefully Im talking about the Rotorians Suppose they did colonize the planet Why would they want to remain under the red light of the Neighbor Star light in which their Rotorian plant life would not flourish and under which they themselves would grow despondent Underground they could have artificial lighting and both they and their plants would be better off Besides
	He paused and Wendel said Go on What else
	Well you have to understand the Rotorians They live on the inside of a world Its what theyre used to and what they consider normal They wouldnt find it comfortable to cling to the outside skin of a world They would dig underneath as a matter of course
	Wendel said Then youre suggesting that Blankowitzs neuronic detector is detecting the presence of human beings under the surface of the planet
	Yes Why not Its the thickness of the soil between their caverns and the surface that weakens the response the neuronic detector is measuring
	Wendel said But Blankowitz gets more or less the same response over both land and sea
	Over the entire planet Its very even said Blankowitz
	All right said Fisher Native intelligence in the sea Rotorians underground on land Why not
	Wait said Jarlow You get a response everywhere Blankowitz Right
	Everywhere Ive detected some slight ups and downs but the response is so shallow I cant really be sure Certainly there seems to be some intelligence everywhere on the planet
	Jarlow said I suppose thats possible in the sea but how is it possible on land Do you suppose that Rotorians in thirteen years in thirteen years have dug a network of tunnels under all the land surface of this world If you got one area of response or even twosmall ones taking up a tiny fraction of the worlds surfaceId consider the possibility of Rotorian burrowing But the entire surface Please Tell that to my aunt Tillie
	Wu said Am I to take it Henry that you are suggesting that there is an alien intelligence underground everywhere on the land surface
	Jarlow said I dont see what other conclusion we can come to unless we want to conclude that Blankowitzs device is completely meaningless
	In that case said Wendel I wonder if its safe to go down and investigate An alien intelligence is not necessarily a friendly intelligence and the Superluminal is not equipped to make war
	Wu said I dont think we can give up We must find out what kind of intelligent life is present and how it might interfereif at allwith any plans we may make to evacuate Earth and come here
	Blankowitz said There is one place where the response is a tiny bit more intense than it is anywhere else Not much Shall I try to find it again
	Wendel said Go ahead Try We can examine the surroundings there carefully and then decide whether to descend or not
	Wu smiled blandly Im sure it will be entirely safe to do so Wendel merely scowled unhappily
	The peculiar thing about Saltade Leverett in the opinion of Janus Pitt was that he liked it out in the asteroid belt Apparently there were some people who truly enjoyed emptiness who loved inanimacy
	I dont dislike people Leverett would explain I can get all I want of them on holovisiontalk to them listen to them laugh with them I can do everything but feel them and smell them and who wants to do that Besides were building five Settlements in the asteroid belt and I can visit anyone of them and get my fill of people and smell them too for what good that does me
	And then when he did come to Rotorthe metropolis as he insisted on calling ithe would keep looking from one side to the other as though he expected people to crowd in on him
	He even looked at chairs suspiciously and sat down on them with a sidewise slide as though hoping to wipe off the aura that the previous backside had left upon it
	Janus Pitt had always thought he was the ideal Acting Commissioner for the Asteroid Project That position had in effect given him a free hand in everything that had to do with the outer rim of the Nemesian System That included not only the Settlements in progress but with the Scanning Service itself
	They had finished their lunch in the privacy of Pitts quarters for Saltade would sooner go hungry than eat in a dining room to which the general public meaning even a third person who was unknown to him would be admitted Pitt in fact felt a certain surprise that Leverett had agreed to eat with him 
	Pitt studied him casually Leverett was so lean and leathery and gave such an appearance of whipcord and gristle that he didnt look as if he had ever been young or would ever be old His eyes were faded blue his hair faded yellow
	Pitt said When was the last time you were on Rotor Saltade
	Nearly two years ago and I take it unkindly of you to put me  through this Janus
	Why what have I done I certainly havent summoned you here though since you are here old friend youre welcome
	You might as well have summoned me Whats this message you sent out to the effect that you were not to be bothered with little things Are you getting to the point where youre so big you want only big things
	Pitts smile grew a trifle strained I dont know what youre talking about Saltade
	They had a report for you They detected a small bit of radiation coming in from outside They sent it to you and you sent back one of your special memos about how you couldnt be bothered
	Oh that Pitt remembered It had been that moment of selfpity and irritation Surely he was allowed to be irritated at times Well your people are watching for Settlements They shouldnt bother me with minor matters
	If thats your attitude fine But it so happens theyve found something thats not a Settlement and they dont want to report it to you Theyve reported it to me and theyve requested me to pass it on to you despite your order that you are not to be bothered with minutiae They figure its my job to handle you but Id rather not Janus Are you becoming a cantankerous fellow in your powerful old age
	Dont rattle on Saltade What is it theyve reported said Pitt with more than a touch of cantankerousness about him
	They spotted a vessel
	What do you meana vessel Not a Settlement
	Leverett held up a gnarled paw Not a Settlement I said a vessel
	I dont understand
	Whats to understand Do you need a computer If so yours is right there A vessel is a ship making its way through space with a crew on board 
	How large
	It could carry half a dozen people I suppose
	Then it must be one of ours 
	It isnt Everyone of ours is accounted for This one is simply not of Rotorian manufacture The Scanning Service may have been reluctant to talk to you about it but they did some work on their own No computer anywhere in the system has been involved with the construction of any ship like that vessel and no one could have built a vessel like that without computer involvement at some stage
	Then you conclude
	That its not a Rotorian vessel It comes from elsewhere As long as there was the slightest chance that it might have been produced by us my boys kept quiet and didnt disturb you per your instructions When it appeared definitely not to be one of our own they passed it on to me and said you should be told but that they wouldnt do it You know Janus past a certain point trampling on people is counterproductive
	Shut up said Pitt peevishly How could it be nonRotorian Where would it come from
	I suppose it had to come from the Solar System
	Impossible A vessel of the size you describe with half a dozen people onboard couldnt possibly have made the trip from the Solar System Even if they discovered hyperassistance and it is certainly conceivable they did a halfdozen people at close quarters for over two years could not complete the trip alive Maybe there are some exemplary crews welltrained and unusually suited to the task who could make the trip and end up at least partly sane but nobody in the Solar System would risk it Nothing less than a complete Settlement a selfcontained world occupied by people accustomed to it from birth could possibly make an interstellar trip and do well
	Nevertheless said Leverett we have here a small vessel of nonRotorian manufacture Thats a fact and you have no choice but to accept that I promise you Where do you say it came from The nearest star is the Sun thats a fact too If it didnt come from the Solar System then it came from some other star system and the journey was a good deal longer than two years and a bit If two years and a bit is impossible everything else is certainly impossible
	Pitt said Suppose its not human at all Suppose these are other forms of life with other psychologies that can endure long trips at close quarters
	Or suppose they are people this bigand Leverett held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch apartand that the vessel is a Settlement for them Wellits not so Theyre not aliens Theyre not teenyweenies That vessel isnt Rotorian but it is human Wed expect aliens to look completely different from human beings and they ought to build ships completely different from those of human beings That vessel is a human vessel right down to the serial code along its side which is in the terrestrial alphabet
	You didnt say that
	I didnt think it needed saying Pitt said It could be a human ship but it could be automated It could have robots onboard
	It could said Leverett In that case should we blow it out of the sky If there are no human beings onboard there are no ethical problems involved You destroy property but after all theyre trespassing
	Pitt said Im considering it
	Leverett smiled broadly Dont That vessel has not spent more than two years traveling through space
	What do you mean
	Have you forgotten the condition Rotor was in when we arrived here We did spend over two years in passage and half of that time we were in normal space going at just under the speed of light At that speed the surface was abraded by collision with atoms molecules and dust particles It took polishing and repairs as I recall Dont you remember
	And this ship said Pitt without bothering to say whether he remembered
	As shiny as though it had traveled no more than a few million kilometers at ordinary speeds
	Thats impossible Dont bother me with these games
	Its not impossible A few million kilometers at ordinary speeds is all they passed through The rest of the wayhyperspace
	What are you talking about Pitts patience was wearing thin Superluminal flight Theyve got it
	Thats theoretically impossible
	Is it Well if you can think of any other way of explaining all this go to it
	Pitt stared at him openmouthed But
	I know The physicists say its impossible but they have it anyway Now let me tell you this If they have superluminal flight they must have superluminal communication Then the Solar System knows theyre here and it knows whats happening If we blow the ship out of the sky the Solar System will know that too and after a while a fleet of such vessels will come out of space and theyll come shooting at us
	What would you do then Pitt found himself temporarily unable to think
	What else is there to do but to greet them in friendly fashion find out what they are who they are what theyre doing and what they want Now its my idea that they plan to land on Erythro Well have to land there too and talk to them
	On Erythro
	If theyre on Erythro Janus where do you want us to be Weve got to confront them there Weve got to take that chance
	Pitt felt his mind beginning to tick over again He said Since this seems to you to be necessary would you be willing to do it With a ship and a crew of course
	You mean you wont
	As Commissioner I cant come down to greet some unknown ship
	Beneath the official dignity I see So Im to face the aliens or the teenyweenies or the robots or whatever without you
	Ill be in constant contact of course Saltade Voice and image
	At a distance
	Yes but a successful mission on your part would be suitably rewarded after all
	Is that so In that case Leverett looked at Pitt speculatively Pitt waited then said  Are you going to name a price
	I am going to suggest a price If you want me to meet this vessel on Erythro then I want Erythro
	What do you mean
	I want Erythro as my home Im tired of the asteroids Im tired of scanning Im tired of people Ive had enough I want a whole empty world I want to build nice living quarters get food and necessaries from the Dome have my own farm and my own animals if I can coax them to do well
	How long have you wanted this
	I dont know Its been growing on me And since I came here and have gotten a good look at Rotor with its crowds and noise Erythro looks better than ever to me
	Pitt frowned That makes two of you Youre just like that mad girl
	What mad girl
	Eugenia Insignas daughter You know Insigna I suppose
	The astronomer Of course I havent met her daughter
	Completely mad She wants to stay on Erythro
	I dont consider that mad I consider that very sensible In fact if she wants to say on Erythro I could endure a woman
	Pitt held up a finger I said girl 
	How old is she
	Fifteen
	Oh Well shell get older Unfortunately so will I
	Shes not one of your raving beauties
	If youll take a good look Janus said Leverett neither am I You have my terms
	You want it officially recorded in the computer
	Just as a formality eh Janus
	Pitt did not smile Very well Well try to watch where that vessel lands and well make you ready for Erythro


ThirtySix Meeting


	Eugenia Insigna said in a tone that seemed to place her halfway between puzzlement and discontent Marlene was singing this morning Some song about Home home in the stars where the worlds are all swinging and free 
	I know the song said Siever Genarr nodding Id sing it for you but I cant carry a tune
	They had just finished lunch They had lunch together every day now something Genarr looked forward to with quiet satisfaction even though the subject of conversation was invariably Marlene and although Genarr felt that Insigna might be turning to him only out of desperation since to whom else could she talk freely on the subject
	He didnt care Whatever the excuse
	I never heard her sing before said Insigna I always thought she couldnt Actually she has a pleasant contralto
	It must be a sign that shes happy nowor excitedor contentedor something good Eugenia My own feeling is that shes found her place in the Universe found her unique reason for living Its not given to all of us to find that Most of us Eugenia drag onward searching for lifes personal meaning not finding it and ending with anything from roaring desperation to quiet resignation Im the quietly resigned type myself
	Insigna managed to smile I suspect you dont think that of me
	Youre not roaringly desperate Eugenia but you do tend to continue to fight lost battles Her eyes dropped Do you mean Crile Genarr said If you think I do then I do But actually I was thinking of Marlene Shes been out a dozen times She loves it It makes her happy and yet you sit here fighting off terror What is it Eugenia that bothers you about it
	Insigna ruminated pushing her fork around on her plate Then she said Its the sense of loss The unfairness of it Crile made a choice and I lost him Marlene has made a choice and Im losing herif not to the Plague then to Erythro
	I know He reached for her hand and she placed it rather absently in his
	She said Marlene is more and more eager to be out there in that absolute wilderness and less and less interested in being with us Eventually she will find a way of living out there and return at lengthening intervalsthen be gone
	Youre probably right but all of life is a symphony of successive losses You lose your youth your parents your loves your friends your comforts your health and finally your life To deny loss is to lose it all anyway and to lose in addition your selfpossession and your peace of mind
	She was never a happy child Siever
	Do you blame yourself for that
	I might have been more understanding
	Its never too late to start Marlene wanted a whole world and she has it She wanted to convert what has always been a burdensome ability of hers into a method for communicating directly with another mind and she has it Would you force her to give that up Would you avoid your own loss of her more or less continuous presence by inflicting on her a greater loss than you or I can conceivethe true use of her unusual brain
	Insigna actually laughed a little though her eyes were swimming with tears You could talk a rabbit out of its hole Siever
	Could I My speech was never as effective as Criles silences Insigna said There were other influences She frowned It doesnt matter Youre here now Siever and youre a great comfort to me
	Genarr said ruefully Its the surest sign that I have reached my present age that I am actually comforted at being a comfort to you The fires burn low when we ask not for this or that but for comfort
	Theres nothing wrong with that surely
	Nothing wrong in the world I suspect there are many couples who have gone through the wilds of passion and the rites of ecstasy without ever finding comfort in each other and in the end they might have been willing to exchange it all for comfort I dont know The quiet victories are so quiet Essential but overlooked
	Like you my poor Siever
	Now Eugenia Ive spent all my life trying to avoid the trap of selfpity and you mustnt tempt me into it just to watch me writhe
	Oh Siever I dont want to watch you writhe
	There I just wanted to hear you say that See how clever I am But you know if you want a substitute for Marlenes presence I am willing to hang around when you need comfort Even a whole world to myself wouldnt tempt me from your sideif you didnt want me to go
	She squeezed his hand I dont deserve you Siever
	Dont use that as an excuse not to have me Eugenia Im willing to waste myself on you and you shouldnt stop me from making a supreme sacrifice
	Have you found no one worthier
	I havent looked Nor have I sensed among the women of Rotor any great demand for me Besides what would I do with a worthier object How dull it would be to offer myself as a duly deserved gift How much more romantic to be an undeserved gift to be bounty from the skies
	To be godlike in your condescension to the unworthy Genarr nodded vigorously I like that Yes Yes Thats exactly the picture that appeals to me
	Insigna laughed again and more freely Youre crazy too You know I never noticed that somehow
	I have hidden depths As you get to know me still bettertaking your time of course
	He was interrupted by the sharp buzz of the messagereceiver
	He frowned There you are Eugenia I get you to the pointI dont even remember how I did itwhere you are ready to melt into my arms and were interrupted Uh oh His voice suddenly changed completely Its from Saltade Leverett
	Whos he
	You dont know him Hardly anyone does Hes the nearest thing to a hermit Ive ever met He works in the asteroid belt because he likes it there I havent seen the old bum in years I dont know why I say old though because hes my age
	Its sealed too Sealed to my thumbprints I see That makes it secret enough for me to ask you to leave before I open it
	Insigna rose at once but Genarr motioned her down Dont be silly Eugenia Secrecy is just the disease of officialdom I pay no attention to it
	He pressed his thumb down on the sheet then the other thumb in its appropriate place and letters began to appear Genarr said I often thought that if a person lacked thumbs And then he fell silent
	Still silent he passed her the message Am I allowed to read this
	Genarr shook his head Of course not but who cares Read it She did so almost at a glance then looked up An alien ship
	About to land here 
	Genarr nodded  At least thats what it says
	Insigna said wildly But what about Marlene Shes out there
	Erythro will protect her
	How do you know This may be a ship of aliens Real aliens Nonhumans The thing on Erythro may have no power over them
	Were aliens to Erythro yet it can easily control us
	I must go out there
	What good
	I must be with her Come with me Help me Well bring her back into the Dome
	If these are allpowerful and malevolent invaders we wont be safe inside
	Oh Siever is this a time for logic Please I must be with my daughter
	They had taken photographs and now they were studying them Tessa Wendel shook her head Unbelievable The whole world is absolutely desolate Except this
	Intelligence everywhere said Merry Blankowitz her brow furrowed No question about it now when weve been so close Desolate or not intelligence is there
	But most intensely at that dome Right
	Most intensely Captain Most easily noticeable And most familiar Outside the dome there are slight differences and Im not sure what it signifies
	Wu said Weve never tested any high intelligence other than human so of course
	Wendel turned to him Is it your opinion the intelligence outside the dome isnt human
	Since we agree that human beings couldnt have burrowed everywhere underground in thirteen years what other conclusion is it possible to come to
	And the dome Is that human
	Wu said Thats a different thing entirely and doesnt depend on Blankowitzs plexons There are astronomical instruments to be seen The domeor part of itis an astronomical observatory
	Couldnt alien intelligences be astronomers as well asked Jarlow a bit sardonically
	Of course said Wu but with instruments of their own When I see what looks to me like an infrared computerized scanner of exactly the type I would see on EarthWell lets put it this way Forget the nature of the intelligence I see instruments that were either manufactured in the Solar System or built from designs prepared in the Solar System There is no question about that I cannot conceive that alien intelligences without contact with human beings could have built such instruments
	Very well said Wendel I agree with you Wu Whatever there is on this world there are or were human beings under that dome
	Crile Fisher said sharply Dont just say human beings Captain There are Rotorians There can be no other human beings on this world excluding ourselves
	Wu said  And thats unanswerable too
	Blankowitz said Its such a small dome Rotor must have had tens of thousands of people on it
	Sixty thousand murmured Fisher They cant all fit into that dome
	For one thing said Fisher there may be other domes We could sweep around the world a thousand times and yet miss objects of all sorts
	Theres only this one place where there seemed to be a change in the plexon type If there were other domes like that I would have spotted a few more of them Im sure Blankowitz said
	Or said Fisher another possibility is that what we see is a tiny bit of an entire structure which for all we know may spread out for miles below the surface
	Wu said The Rotorians came in a Settlement The Settlement may still exist There may be many This dome may be a mere outpost
	We havent seen a Settlement said Jarlow
	We havent looked said Wu Weve concentrated entirely on this world
	I havent spotted intelligence anywhere but on this world said Blankowitz
	You havent looked either said Wu Wed really have to scan the heavens to spot a Settlement or two but once you detected plexons from this world you looked nowhere else
	I will if you think its necessary
	Wendel held up her hand If there are Settlements why havent they spotted us Weve made no attempt to shield our energy emissions After all we were pretty confident that this star system was empty
	Wu said They may have had the same overconfidence Captain They havent been looking for us either and so weve slipped past them Of if they have detected us they may be uncertain as to whoor whatwe are and theyre hesitating as to what action to take just as we are What I say though is that we do know one spot on the surface of this large satellite where there must be human beings and I think we must go down and make contact with them
	Do you think it would be safe to do so asked Blankowitz
	My guess said Wu firmly is that it would be They cant shoot us out of hand After all theyd want to know more about us before they do so Besides if all we dare do is stay here in uncertainty then we will accomplish absolutely nothing and we ought to go back home and tell them what we have discovered Earth will send out a whole fleet of superluminal vessels but they wont be thankful to us if we come back with only minimal information Well go down in history as the expedition that flinched He smiled blandly You see Captain Ive learned a few lessons from Fisher
	Wendel said Then you think we should now go down and make contact
	Absolutely said Wu
	And you Blankowitz
	Im curious Not about the dome but about the possible alien life Id want to find out about them too
	Jarlow
	I wish we had adequate weapons or hypercommunication If were wiped out Earth will have found out nothingabsolutely nothingas the result of our trip Then it might be that someone else will come here as unprepared as we and just as unsure Still if we survive the contact well be going back with important knowledge I suppose we should chance it
	Fisher said quietly Are you going to ask me for my opinion Captain
	I assume that you wish to land to see the Rotorians
	Exactly so may I suggestLets land as quietly as we can and as unobtrusively and Ill leave the ship to reconnoiter If anything goes wrong then take off and return to Earth leaving me behind I am dispensable but the ship must return
	Wendel said at once her face seeming to tighten Why you Fisher said Because I know the Rotorians at least and because I wish to go 
	I too said Wu I must be with you
	Why risk two asked Fisher
	Because two are safer than one Because in case of trouble one might escape while the other holds off the threat And most of all because as you say you know the Rotorians Your judgment may be warped
	Wendell said We will land then Fisher and Wu will leave the ship If at any time Fisher and Wu disagree on procedure Wu will be the decisionmaker
	Why demanded Fisher indignantly
	Wu has said you know the Rotorians and your decisions may be warped said Wendel looking at Fisher firmly and I agree with him
	Marlene was happy She felt as if she were wrapped in gentle arms protected shielded She could see the reddish light of Nemesis and feel the wind against her cheeks She could watch the clouds obscure part or all of Nemesis large globe now and then so that the light would dim and turn grayish
	But she could see as easily in the gray as in the red and she could see in shades and tints that made fascinating patterns And though the wind grew cooler when Nemesis light was hidden it never chilled her It was as though Erythro were somehow enhancing her sight somehow warming the air around her body when necessary somehow caring for her in every way
	And she could talk to Erythro She had made up her mind to think of the cells that made up the life on Erythro as Erythro As the planet Why not What else Individually the cells were only cells as primitivemuch more primitive in factthan the individual cells of her own body It was only all of the prokaryote cells together that made up an organism that encircled the planet in a billion trillion tiny interconnected pieces that so filled and permeated and grasped the planet that it might as well be thought of as the planet
	How odd thought Marlene This giant lifeform must never before the coming of Rotor have known that anything live existed other than itself
	Her questions and sensations did not have to exist entirely in her mind Erythro would rise before her sometimes like thin gray smoke consolidating into a wraithlike human figure wavering at the edges There was always about it a flowing feeling She could not actually see that but she sensed beyond doubt that millions of invisible cells were leaving each second and immediately being replaced by others No one prokaryote cell could exist for long out of its water film so that each was only evanescently part of the figure but the figure itself was as permanent as it wished to be and never lost its identity
	Erythro did not take Aurinels form again It had gathered without being told that that was disturbing Its appearance was neutral now changing slightly with the vagaries of Marlenes own thought Erythro could follow the delicate changes of her mind pattern far better she decided than she herself could and the figure adjusted to that looking more like some figure in her minds eye at one moment and then as she tried to focus on it and identify it it would shift gently into something else Occasionally she could catch glimpses the curve of her mothers cheek Uncle Sievers strong nose bits of the girls and boys she had met at school
	It was an interactive symphony It was not so much a conversation between them as a mental ballet she could not describe something that was infinitely soothing infinite in varietypartly changing appearancepartly changing voicepartly changing thought
	It was a conversation in so many dimensions that the possibility of going back to communication that consisted only of speech left her feeling flat lifeless Her gift of sensing by body language flowered into something she had never imagined earlier Thoughts could be exchanged far more swiftlyand deeplythan by the coarse crudeness of speech
	Erythro explainedfilled her ratherwith the shock of encountering other minds Minds Plural One more might have been grasped easily Another world Another mind But to encounter many minds crowding on each other each different overlapping in small space Unthinkable
	The thoughts that permeated Marlenes mind as Erythro expressed itself could be expressed only distantly and unsatisfactorily in words Behind those words overflowing and drowning them were the emotions the feelings the neuronic vibrations that shattered Erythro into a rearrangement of concepts
	It had experimented with the mindsfelt them Not felt as human beings would mean felt but something else entirely that could be approached very distantly by that human word and concept And some of the minds crumpled decayed became unpleasant Erythro ceased to feel minds at random but sought out minds that would withstand the contact
	And you found me said Marlene I found you
	But why Why did you look for me she asked eagerly The figure wavered and turned smokier Just to find you It was no answer Why do you want me to be with you The figure started to fade and the thought was a fugitive one Just to be with me
	And it was gone
	Only its image was gone Marlene felt its protection still its warm enclosure But why had it disappeared Had she displeased it with her questions
	She heard a sound On an empty world it is possible to catalogue the sounds briefly for there arent many There is the noise of flowing water and the more delicate moan of blowing air There are the predictable noises you make yourself whether the falling of a footstep the rustle of clothing or the whistle of breath
	Marlene heard something that was none of these and turned in the direction of it Over the rocky outcropping on her left there appeared the head of a man
	Her first thought of course was that it was someone from the Dome who had come to get her and she felt a surge of anger Why would they still be searching for her She would refuse to wear a waveemitter from now on and they would then have no way of locating her except by blind search
	But she did not recognize the face and surely she had met everyone in the Dome by now She might not know the individual names or anything about them but she would know when she saw anyone from the Dome that she had seen that face before
	She had not seen this new face anywhere in the Dome Those eyes were staring at her The mouth was a little open as if the person were panting And then whoever it was was topping the rise and running to her
	She faced him The protection she felt around her was strong She was not afraid
	He stopped ten feet away staring leaning forward as though he had reached a barrier he could not penetrate one that deprived him of the ability to advance farther
	Finally he said in a strangled voice Roseanne
	Marlene stared at him observing carefully His micromovements were eager and radiated a sense of ownership possession closeness mine mine mine
	She took a step backward How was that possible Why should he
	A dim memory of a holoimage she had once seen when she was a little girl
	And finally she could deny it no more However impossible it sounded however unimaginable
	She huddled within the protective blanket and said Father
	He rushed at her as though he wanted to seize her in his arms and she stepped away again He paused swaying then put one hand to his forehead as though fighting dizziness
	He said Marlene I meant to say Marlene
	He pronounced it incorrectly Marlene noticed Two syllables But that was right for him How would he know
	A second man came up and stood next to him He had straight black hair a wide face narrow eyes a sallow complexion Marlene had never seen a man who quite looked like him She gaped a little and had to make an effort to close her mouth
	The second man said to the first in a soft incredulous voice Is this your daughter Fisher
	Marlenes eyes widened Fisher It was her father
	Her father didnt look at the other man Only at her Yes
	The other said even more softly First deal of the cards Fisher You come here and the first person you meet is your daughter
	Fisher seemed to make an effort to turn his eyes from his daughter but he failed I think thats it Wu Marlene your last name is Fisher isnt it Your mother is Eugenia Insigna Am I right My name is Crile Fisher and Im your father
	He held out his arms to her
	Marlene was well aware that the look of yearning on her fathers face was completely real but she stepped back yet again and said coldly How is it youre here
	I came from Earth to find you To find you After all these years
	Why did you want to find me You left me when I was a baby
	I had to then but it was always with the intention of coming back for you
	And another voiceharsh steelybroke in and said So you came back for Marlene For nothing else
	Eugenia Insigna was standing there face pale lips almost colorless hands trembling Behind her was Siever Genarr looking astonished but remaining in the background Neither one was wearing protective clothing
	Insigna said voice hurried semihysterical I thought there would be people from some Settlement people from the Solar System I thought there might be some alien lifeform I went through every possibility I could think of and in all the thoughts that crowded in on me after I was told a strange ship was landing I never once thought it might be Crile Fisher coming back And for Marlene
	I came with others on an important mission This is ChaoLi Wu a shipmate Andand
	And we meet Did it ever occur to you that you might encounter me Or were your thoughts entirely on Marlene What was your important mission To find Marlene
	No That was not the mission Just my desire
	And I
	Fishers eyes fell I came for Marlene
	You came for her To take her away
	I thought began Fisher and his words stuck
	Wu watched him wonderingly Genarr frowned in thoughtful anger
	Insigna whirled toward her daughter Marlene would you go anywhere with this man
	Im not going anywhere with anyone Mother said Marlene quietly
	Insigna said Theres your answer Crile You cant leave me with my child of a year and come back fifteen years later with a By the way Ill take her over now And not a thought of me Shes your daughter biologically but nothing more Shes mine by the right of fifteen years of loving and caring
	Marlene said There is no point in quarreling over me Mother ChaoLi Wu stepped forward Pardon me I have been introduced but no one has been introduced to me You are madam
	Eugenia Insigna Fisher She pointed at Fisher His wifeonce 
	And this is your daughter madam
	Yes This is Marlene Fisher
	Wu bowed slightly And this other gentleman
	Genarr said Im Siever Genarr Commander of the Dome that you see behind me on the horizon
	Ah good Commander I would like to speak to you I regret that there seems to be a family argument here but it has nothing to do with our mission
	And just what is your mission growled another new voice Coming toward them was a whitehaired figure his mouth turned down with something that looked very much like a weapon in his hand
	Hello Siever he said as he passed Genarr
	Genarr looked startled Saltade Why are you here
	I am representing Commissioner Janus Pitt of Rotor I repeat my question to you sir What is your mission And what is your name
	My name at least said Wu is easily given It is Dr ChaoLi Wu And you sir
	Saltade Leverett
	Greetings We come in peace said Wu eyeing the weapon
	I hope so said Leverett grimly I have six ships with me and theyve got your ship in their sights
	Indeed said Wu This small dome With a fleet
	This small dome is only a tiny outpost said Leverett I have the fleet Do not count on a bluff
	I will take your word for it said Wu But our one small ship comes from Earth It got here because it has the capacity for superluminal flight Do you know what I mean Fasterthanlight travel
	I know what you mean
	Genarr said suddenly Is Dr Wu telling the truth Marlene
	Yes he is Uncle Siever said Marlene Interesting murmured Genarr
	Wu said calmly I am delighted to have my word confirmed by this young lady Am I to suppose she is Rotors expert on superluminal flight
	You need not suppose anything said Leverett impatiently Why are you here You have not been invited
	No we havent We didnt know that anyone was here to object to us But I urge you not to give in unnecessarily to any bad temper At any false move from you our ship will just disappear into hyperspace
	Marlene said quickly Hes not certain about that
	Wu frowned Im certain enough And even if you manage to destroy the ship our home base on Earth knows where we are and is getting constant reports If anything happens to us the next expedition will be one of fifty superluminal battle cruisers Dont risk it sir
	Marlene said That is not so
	Genarr said What is not so Marlene
	When he said that the home base on Earth knows where he is that was not so and he knew that was not so
	Genarr said Thats good enough for me Saltade these people do not have hypercommunication
	Wus expression did not change Are you relying on the speculation of a teenage girl 
	Its not speculation Its a certainty Saltade Ill explain later Take my word for it
	Marlene said suddenly Ask my father Hell tell you She didnt quite understand how her father would know about her giftshe had surely not had it or at least had not displayed it when she was one year old but his understanding was clear It shouted itself at her for all that others could not see it
	Fisher said Its no use Wu Marlene can see right through us For the first time Wus coolness seemed to desert him He frowned
	and said tartly How would you know anything at all about this girl even if shes your daughter You havent seen her since she was an infant
	I had a younger sister once said Fisher in a low voice
	Genarr said with sudden enlightenment It runs in the family then Interesting Well Dr Wu you see we have a tool here that allows no bluffing Let us then be open with each other Why have you come to this world
	To save the Solar System Ask the young ladysince she is your absolute authorityif I am telling the truth this time
	Marlene said Of course youre telling the truth Dr Wu We know about the danger My mother discovered it
	Wu said  And we discovered it too little lady without any help from your mother
	Saltade Leverett looked from one to another and said May I ask what youre all talking about
	Genarr said Believe me Saltade Janus Pitt knows all about it Im sorry he hasnt told you but if you get in touch with him now he will Tell him we are dealing with people who know how to travel faster than light and that we might be able to make a deal
	The four of them sat in Siever Genarrs private quarters in the Dome and Genarr tried to keep his sense of history from overwhelming him This was the first example in human history of an interstellar negotiation If each of the four were famous for nothing else their names would ring down the corridors of Galactic history for this alone
	Two and two
	There on the side of the Solar System Earth really and who would have thought that decadent Earth would be representing the Solar System that they should have developed superluminal flight rather than one of the uptodate livewire Settlements were ChaoLi Wu and Crile Fisher
	Wu was talkative and insinuating a mathematician but one who was clearly possessed of practical acumen Fisher on the other hand and Genarr still could not accustom himself to the notion that he was actually seeing him again sat there quietly lost in thought and contributing little
	On his own side was Saltade Leverett suspicious and uneasy at being in such close contact with three at once but firmlacking the wordy flow of Wu yet having no trouble in making himself clear
	As for Genarr he was as quiet as Fisher but he was waiting for them to settle the mattersince he knew something the other three did not
	Night had fallen by now and hours had passed First lunch then dinner had been served There had been breaks to snap the tension and during one of them Genarr had gone out to see Eugenia Insigna and Marlene
	Its not going badly said Genarr Both sides have a great deal to gain
	What about Crile asked Insigna nervously Has he brought up the matter of Marlene
	Honestly Eugenia that is not the subject of discussion and he has not brought her up I do think he is very unhappy about it
	He should be said Insigna bitterly
	Genarr hesitated What do you think Marlene
	Marlene looked at him with her dark unfathomable eyes Ive gotten beyond that Uncle Siever 
	A little hardhearted muttered Genarr
	But Insigna snapped at him Why shouldnt she be Deserted in infancy
	Im not hardhearted said Marlene thoughtfully If I can arrange to have his mind eased I will But I dont belong with him you see Or with you either Mother Im sorry but I belong with Erythro Uncle Siever you will tell me whats decided wont you
	I promised I would
	Its important
	I know
	I should be there to represent Erythro
	I imagine that Erythro is there but you will be part of it before its over Even if I didnt assure you of that Marlene which I do I think that Erythro would see to it
	And then he returned to continue the discussion ChaoLi Wu was leaning back in his seat now his astute face showing no signs of weariness
	Let me summarize he said In the absence of superluminal flight this Neighbor StarI shall call it Nemesis as you dois the nearest star to the Solar System so that any ship making its way to the stars would be bound to stop here first Once all humanity has true superluminal flight however distance is no longer a factor and human beings will not search out the nearest star but the most comfortable star The search will be on for Sunlike stars that happen to be circled by at least one Earthlike planet Nemesis will be put to one side
	Rotor which has till now apparently made a fetish of secrecy to keep others away and to reserve this stellar system for itself need do so no more Not only will this system be unwanted by other settlements but Rotor itself may no longer want it It may choose if it so desires to search out Sunlike stars for itself There are billions of such stars in the spiral arms of the Galaxy
	In order for Rotor to have superluminal flight it might occur to you that you could point a weapon at me and demand all I know I am a mathematician a highly theoretical one and my information is limited Even if you were to capture our ship itself you would learn very little from it What you must do is to send a deputation of scientists and engineers to Earth where we could train you adequately
	In return we ask for this world which you call Erythro It is my understanding that you do not occupy it in any way except for the presence of this Dome which is used for astronomical and other kinds of research You are living in Settlements
	Whereas the Settlements of the Solar System can wander off in search of Sunlike planets the people of Earth cannot There are eight billion of us who must be evacuated in a few thousand years and as Nemesis approaches more and more closely to the Solar System Erythro will more and more easily serve as a way station on which to place Earthpeople until such time as we can find Earthlike worlds to transfer them to
	We will return to Earth with a Rotorian of your choosing as proof that we were really here More ships will be built and they will returnyou can be sure we will return for we must have Erythro We will then take back your scientists who will learn the technique of superluminal flight a technique we will also grant to the other Settlements Does all this adequately summarize what we have decided
	Leverett said Its not all quite that easy Erythro will have to be terraformed if it is to support any sizable number of Earthpeople
	Yes I have left out details said Wu These will have to be dealt with too but not by us
	True Commissioner Pitt and the Council will have to decide on Rotors behalf
	And the Global Congress on Earths behalf but with so much at stake I dont foresee failure
	There will have to be safeguards How far can we trust Earth
	About as far as Earth can trust Rotor I imagine It may take a year to work out safeguards Or five years Or ten years It will take years in any case to build an adequate supply of ships with which to begin but we have a program that should last several thousand years one that will end with the necessary abandonment of Earth and the beginning of the colonization of the Galaxy
	Assuming there are no competing intelligences to be taken into account growled Leverett
	An assumption we can make until we are forced to abandon it That is for the future Will you consult your Commissioner now Will you choose your Rotorian to accompany us and allow us to leave for Earth as soon as possible
	Now Fisher leaned forward May I suggest that my daughter Marlene be the one
	But Genarr did not allow the sentence to be completed Im sorry Crile Ive consulted her She will not leave this world
	If her mother goes with her then
	No Crile Her mother has nothing to do with it Even if you wanted Eugenia back and Eugenia were to decide to go with you Marlene would still remain on Erythro And if you decided to stay here to be with her that would do you no good either She is lost to you and to her mother as well
	Fisher said angrily Shes only a child She cant make these decisions
	Unfortunately for you and for Eugenia and for all of us here and perhaps for all of humanity she can make these decisions In fact I have promised that when we are through here as I think we now are that we will acquaint her with our decisions
	Wu said Surely that is not necessary
	Leverett said Come Siever we dont have to go to a little girl for permission
	Genarr said Please listen to me It is necessary and we do have to go to her Allow me to try an experiment I am suggesting that Marlene be brought in here so that we can tell her what we have decided If one of you thinks that is not desirable let him leave Let him stand up and leave
	Leverett said I think youve taken leave of your senses Siever I have no intention of playing games with a teenager Im going to speak to Pitt Where do you keep your transmitter
	He stood up and almost at once staggered and fell Wu halfrose in alarm Mr Leverett
	Leverett rolled over and held up his arm Help me up somebody Genarr helped him to his feet and back into the chair What happened he asked
	Im not sure said Leverett I had this blinding headache for just a moment
	So you were not able to leave the room Genarr turned to Wu Since you dont think seeing Marlene is necessary would you care to leave the room
	Very carefully eyes fixed on Genarr Wu rose slowly from his chair winced and sat down again
	He said politely Perhaps we had better see the young woman Genarr said We must On this world at least what that young woman wishes is the law
	No said Marlene so forcibly that it amounted almost to a shriek You cant do it 
	Cant do what said Leverett his white eyebrows drawing close to the furrowed line between
	Use Erythro for a way stationor for anything
	Leverett stared at her angrily and his lips drew back as if to speak but Wu intervened Why not young woman It is an empty unused world
	It is not empty It is not unused Uncle Siever tell them
	Genarr said What Marlene wants to say is that Erythro is occupied by innumerable prokaryote cells capable of photosynthesis That is why there is oxygen in Erythros atmosphere
	Very well said Wu What difference does that make
	Genarr cleared his throat Individually the cells are as primitive as life can be above the virus level but apparently they cannot be treated individually Taken all together they form an organism of enormous complexity It is worldgirdling
	An organism Wu remained polite
	A single organism and Marlene calls it by the name of the planet since they are so intimately related
	Wu said  Are you serious How do you know about this organism
	Chiefly through Marlene
	Through the young woman said Wu who may bea hysteric Genarr lifted a finger Do not say anything seriously against her
	Im not sure that Erythrothe organismhas a sense of humor We know chiefly through Marlenenot entirely When Saltade Leverett stood up to leave he was knocked down When you halfrose a while ago perhaps also to leave you were clearly uncomfortable Those are the reactions of Erythro It protects Marlene by acting directly on our minds In the early days of our existence on this world it inadvertently caused a small epidemic of mental disease that we called the Erythro Plague Im afraid that if it wishes it can produce irrecoverable mental damage and if it wishes it can kill Please do not test this
	Fisher said You mean it is not Marlene who
	No Crile Marlene has certain abilities but they dont extend to the point of doing harm It is Erythro that is dangerous
	How do we stop it from being dangerous asked Fisher
	By listening politely to Marlene to begin with Then too let me be the one to talk with her Erythro at least knows me And believe me when I say that I want to save Earth I have no desire to bring about the death of billions
	He turned to Marlene You understand Marlene dont you that Earth is in danger Your mother showed you that the close approach of Nemesis might destroy Earth
	I know that Uncle Siever said Marlene in an agonized voice but Erythro belongs to itself
	It might want to share Marlene It allows the Dome to remain here on the planet We dont seem to disturb it
	But there are less than a thousand people in the Dome and they stay in the Dome Erythro doesnt mind the Dome because that means it can study human minds
	It can study human minds all the more when Earthmen come here
	Eight billion of them
	No not all eight billion Theyll come here to settle down temporarily and then go off somewhere At anyone time therell only be a fraction of the population here
	It will be millions Im sure it will be You cant squeeze them all into a dome and supply them with food and water and all theyll need Youll have to spread them out on Erythro and terraform it Erythro couldnt survive it It would have to protect itself
	Are you sure of that
	It would have to Wouldnt you
	It would mean the death of billions
	I cant help that She pressed her lips together then said Theres a different way
	Leverett said gruffly Whats the girl talking about What different way
	Marlene glanced briefly in Leveretts direction then turned to Genarr I dont know Erythro knows At leastat least it says that the knowledge is here but it cant explain
	Genarr held up both arms to stop what might have been a flurry of questions Let me talk
	Then he said very quietly Marlene be calm If youre worried about Erythro that is useless You know it can protect itself against anything Tell me what you mean when you say Erythro cant explain
	Marlene was breathless and gasping Erythro knows the knowledge is here but it doesnt have human experience human science human ways of thinking It doesnt understand
	The knowledge is in the minds present here
	Yes Uncle Siever
	Cant it probe the minds
	It would hurt them It can probe my mind without hurting it
	I should hope so said Genarr but do you have the knowledge
	No of course not But it can use my mind as a probe for the others here Yours My fathers All
	Is that safe
	Erythro thinks it is butoh Uncle Siever Im afraid
	Surely this is madness whispered Wu and Genarr quickly put a finger to his lips
	Fisher was on his feet Marlene you mustnt
	Genarr waved him back furiously Theres nothing you can do Crile There are billions of human beings at riskwe keep on saying it over and over againand the organism must be allowed to do what it can Marlene
	Marlenes eyes had turned upward She seemed to be in a trance Uncle Siever she whispered Hold me
	Halfstumbling halffalling she moved toward Genarr who seized her and held her tightly MarleneRelaxIt will be all right He sat down carefully in his chair still holding her rigid body
	It was like a silent explosion of light that obliterated the world Nothing existed beyond itself
	Genarr was not even conscious of being Genarr The self did not exist either Only a luminous interconnecting fog of great complexity existed one that was expanding and separating into threads that took on the same great complexity even as they separated
	A whirling and a receding and then an expansion as it approached again On and on hypnotically like something that had always existed and would always exist without end
	Falling endlessly into an opening that widened as it approached without ever getting wider Continuing change without alteration Little puffs unfolding into new complexity
	On and on No sound No sensation Not even vision A consciousness of something that had the properties of light without being light It was the mind becoming aware of itself
	And then painfullyif there had been such a thing as pain in the Universeand with a sobif there had been such a thing as a sound in the Universeit began to dim and turn and spin faster and faster into a point of light that flashed and was gone
	The Universe was obtrusive in its existence
	Wu stretched and said Did anyone else experience that Fisher nodded
	Leverett said Well Im a believer If its madness were all mad together
	But Genarr was still holding Marlene bending over her painfully She was breathing raggedly
	Marlene Marlene
	Fisher had struggled to his feet Is she all right
	I cant say muttered Genarr Shes alive but thats not enough
	Her eyes opened She was staring at Genarr her eyes empty unfocused
	Marlene whispered Genarr in despair
	Uncle Siever whispered Marlene in return
	Genarr let himself breathe At least she had recognized him Dont move he said Wait till its over
	It is over Im so glad its over
	But are you all right
	She paused then said Yes I feel all right Erythro says Im all right
	Wu said Did you find this hidden knowledge were supposed to have
	Yes Dr Wu I did She passed a hand over her damp brow It was you actually who had it 
	I said Wu vehemently What was it
	I dont understand it said Marlene You will maybe if I describe it
	Describe what
	Something thats gravity pushing things away instead of pulling them toward
	Gravitational repulsion yes said Wu Its part of superluminal flight He drew a deep breath and his body straightened Its a discovery I made
	Well then said Marlene if you pass close by Nemesis in superluminal flight theres gravitational repulsion The faster you move the more the repulsion
	Yes the ship would be pushed away
	Wouldnt Nemesis be pushed in the opposite direction
	Yes in inverse ratio of mass but Nemesis move would be immeasurably small
	But what if it were repeated over and over for hundreds of years
	Nemesis movement would still be very small
	But its path would be slightly changed and over the lightyears the distance would mount up and Nemesis might pass Earth just far enough away so that Earth would be spared
	Wu said Well
	Leverett said Could something of the sort be worked out
	We could try An asteroid passing by at ordinary speeds shifting into hyperspace for a trillionth of a second and back at ordinary speed a million miles out Asteroids in orbit around Nemesis always moving into hyperspace on the same side For a moment he was lost in thought Then defensively I would surely have thought of this on my own given a little time
	Genarr said You may still have the credit Marlene took it from your mind after all
	He looked about at the other three and said Well gentlemen unless something goes terribly wrong lets forget about using Erythro as a way station which it wouldnt allow anyway We neednt concern ourselves with evacuating Earthif we can learn to make full and proper use of gravitational repulsion I think the situation has been much improved because we brought in Marlene
	Uncle Siever said Marlene Yes dear
	Im so sleepy
	Tessa Wendel looked at Crile Fisher gravely I keep saying to myself Youre back Somehow I didnt think youd be back once it was clear you had found the Rotorians
	Marlene was the first personthe very first person I found
	He was staring at nothingness and Wendel let him He would have to think it through They had enough to think about in other directions
	They were taking a Rotorian back with them Ranay DAubisson a neurophysicist Twenty years before she had worked in a hospital on Earth There would be records that would serve to identify her And she would be the living proof of what they had done
	Wu was a changed person too He was full of plans for making use of gravitational repulsion to nudge the movement of the Neighbor Star He called it Nemesis now but if he could formulate a plan to move it ever so slightly it might not be Earths nemesis at all
	And Wu had grown modest He didnt want the credit for the discovery which to Wendel seemed completely unbelievable He said the project had been worked out in conference and he would say no more
	Whats more he was definitely planning to return to the Nemesian Systemand not just to run the project He wanted to be there If I have to walk he said
	Wendel became aware that Fisher was looking at her frowning slightly Why didnt you think Id be back Tessa
	She decided to be matter of fact Your wife is younger than I am Crile and she would hold on to your daughter I was sure of that And desperate as you were to have your daughter I thought
	That I would stay with Eugenia because that was the only way
	Something like that
	Fisher shook his head It wouldnt have worked out that way no matter what I thought she was Roseanne at firstmy sister The eyes mostly but there was a Roseanne look about her in other ways too But she was far more than Roseanne Tessa she wasnt human isnt human Ill explain later I He shook his head
	Never mind Crile said Wendel Explain whenever you please
	It hasnt been a total loss Ive seen her Shes alive Shes well And in the end I guess I didnt want more Somehow after myexperience Marlene becamejust Marlene For the rest of my life Tessa you are all I want
	Making the best of it Crile
	A very good best it is Tessa Ill be formally divorced Well be formally married I will leave Rotor and Nemesis to Wu and you and I can stay on Earth or on any Settlement you wish Well each have good pensions and we can leave the Galaxy and its problems to others Weve done enough Tessa That is if thats what you wish too
	I can hardly wait Crile
	An hour later they were still holding each other
	Eugenia Insigna said Im so glad I wasnt there I keep thinking about it Poor Marlene She must have been so afraid
	Yes she was But she did it made it possible to save Earth Even Pitt can do nothing about it now In a sense his whole life work has been made useless Not only is there no purpose to his whole project of secretly building up a new civilization but he has to help supervise the project for the salvation of the Earth He has to Rotor is no longer hidden It can be reached at any time and every bit of humanity on and off Earth will turn against us if we dont rejoin the human race It couldnt have happened without Marlene
	Insigna wasnt thinking of the greater significances She said But when she was frightened really frightened it was to you she turned not to Crile
	Yes
	And you held her not Crile
	Yes but Eugenia dont make anything mystical out of it She knew me but she didnt know Crile
	Youre bound to explain it very sensibly Siever Thats you But Im glad it was you she turned to He didnt deserve her
	Fair enough He didnt deserve her But nowplease Eugenia let go Crile is leaving Hell never be back Hes seen his daughter Hes watched her provide a way to save Earth I dont begrudge him that and you shouldnt either So if you dont mind I am changing the subject Do you know that Ranay D Aubisson is leaving with them
	Yes Everyone is talking about it I wont miss her somehow I never thought she was very sympathetic to Marlene
	Neither were you at times Eugenia Its a great thing for Ranay Once she realized the socalled Erythro Plague was not a useful field of study her work here was shattered but on Earth she can introduce modern brain scanning and have a great professional life
	All right Good for her
	But Wu will be back Very bright man It was his brain that yielded the proper finding You know Im sure that when he comes back to work on the Repulsion Effect his real desire will be to remain on Erythro The Erythro organism has picked him as it had picked Marlene And whats funnier still I think its picked Leverett as well
	What system do you suppose it uses Siever
	Do you mean why does it take Wu and not Crile Why does it take Leverett and not me
	Well I can see that Wu must be a far more brilliant man than Crile but Siever you are much better than Leverett Not that I would have wanted to lose you
	Thank you I presume the Erythro organism has a criterion of its own I even think I have a dim idea of what it might be
	Really
	Yes When my mind was being probed it meant that through Marlene the Erythro organism itself was entering us I caught a glimpse of its thoughts I imagine Not consciously of course but when it was over I seemed to know things I didnt know before Marlene has the strange talent that makes it possible for her to communicate with the organism and makes it also possible for it to use her brain as a probe for other brains but I think thats just a practical advantage It chose her for something far more unusual
	What would that be
	Imagine youre a piece of string Eugenia How would you feel if you suddenly and unexpectedly became aware of a piece of lace Imagine youre a circle How would you feel if you came across a patterned sphere Erythro had knowledge of only one kind of mindits own Its mind is immensely huge but so pedestrian It is what it is only because it is made up of trillions of trillions of cellular units all very loosely connected
	Then it came across human minds in which the cellular units were comparatively few but in which there were incredible numbers of interconnectionsincredible complexity Lace instead of string It must have been overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of it It must have found Marlenes mind to be the most beautiful of all That was why it seized upon her Wouldnt youif you had a chance to acquire a real Rembrandt or a Van Gogh That was why it protected her so avidly Wouldnt you protect a great work of art Yet it risked her for the sake of humanity It was rough on Marlene but rather noble of the organism
	Anyway that is what I consider the Erythro organism to be I consider it an art connoisseur a collector of beautiful minds
	Insigna laughed By that token Wu and Leverett must have very beautiful minds
	They probably do to Erythro And it will continue collecting when scientists from Earth arrive You know it will end by collecting a group of human beings different from the common run The Erythro group It may help them find new homes in space and in the end perhaps the Galaxy will have two kinds of worlds worlds of Earthmen and worlds of more efficient pioneers the true Spacers I wonder how that would work out Surely it would mean the future would lie with them I regret that somehow
	Dont think of that said Insigna urgently Let people of the future deal with the future as it comes Right now you and I are human beings judging each other by human standards
	Genarr smiled joyously his pleasantly homely face lighting up Im glad of that because I find your mind beautiful and perhaps you find mine equally beautiful
	Oh Siever I always did Always Genarrs smile faded somewhat But there are other kinds of beauty I know
	Not for me any longer You have all the kinds of beauty Siever we lost the morning you and I But theres still the afternoon
	In that case what more can I possibly want Eugenia The morning is welllostif we can share the afternoon
	Their hands touched


Epilogue


	Again Janus Pitt sat there alone enclosed
	The red dwarf star was no longer an engine of death It was just a red dwarf star to be pushed to one side by an ever more arrogant humanity growing yet further in power
	But Nemesis still existed though it was no longer the star
	For billions of years life on Earth had been isolated performing its separate experiment rising and sinking flourishing and undergoing vast extinctions Perhaps there were other worlds on which life existed each one isolated for billions of years
	All experimentsall or almost all failures in the long run One or perhaps two that were successes and worth all the rest
	But that was only if the Universe were large enough to isolate all the experiments If Rotortheir Arkhad been isolated as Earth and the Solar System had been it might have been the one to work
	But now he clenched his fists in furyand desperation For he knew that humanity would run from star to star as easily as it had run from continent to continent and before that from region to region There would be no isolation no selfcontained experiments His grand experiment had been discovered and doomed
	The same anarchy the same degeneration the same thoughtless shortterm thinking all the same cultural and social disparities would continue to prevailGalaxywide
	What would there be now Galactic empires All the sins and follies graduated from one world to millions Every woe and every difficulty horribly magnified
	Who would be able to make sense out of a Galaxy when no one had ever made sense out of a single world Who would learn to read the trends and foresee the future in a whole Galaxy teeming with humanity
	Nemesis had indeed come
