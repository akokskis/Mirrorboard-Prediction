CHAPTER I

By tenfortyfive it was all over The town was occupied the defenders defeated and the war finished
	The invader had prepared for this campaign as carefully as he had for larger ones On this Sunday morning the postman and the policeman had gone fishing in the boat of Mr Corell the popular storekeeper He had lent them his trim sailboat for the day The postman and the policeman were several miles at sea when they saw the small dark transport loaded with soldiers go quietly past them As officials of the town this was definitely their business and these two put about but of course the battalion was in possession by the time they could make port The policeman and the postman could not even get into their own offices in the Town Hall and when they insisted on their rights they were taken prisoners of war and locked up in the town jail
	The local troops all twelve of them had been away too on this Sunday morning for Mr Corell the popular storekeeper had donated lunch targets cartridges and prizes for a shootingcompetition to take place six miles back in the hills in a lovely glade Mr Corell owned The local troops big loosehung boys heard the planes and in the distance saw the parachutes and they came back to town at doublequick step When they arrived the invader had flanked the road with machine guns The loosehung soldiers having very little experience in war and none at all in defeat opened fire with their rifles The machine guns clattered for a moment and six of the soldiers became dead riddled bundles and three halfdead riddled bundles and three of the soldiers escaped into the hills with their rifles
	By tenthirty the brass band of the invader was playing beautiful and sentimental music in the town square while the townsmen their mouths a little open and their eyes astonished stood about listening to the music and staring at the grayhelmeted men who carried submachine guns in their arms
	By tenthirtyeight the riddled six were buried the parachutes were folded and the battalion was billeted in Mr Corells warehouse by the pier which had on its shelves blankets and cots for a battalion
	By tenfortyfive old Mayor Orden had received the formal request that he grant an audience to Colonel Lanser of the invaders an audience which was set for eleven sharp at the Mayors fiveroom palace
	The drawingroom of the palace was very sweet and comfortable The gilded chairs covered with their worn tapestry were set about stiffly like too many servants with nothing to do An arched marble fireplace held its little basket of red flameless heat and a handpainted coal scuttle stood on the hearth
	On the mantel flanked by fat vases stood a large curly porcelain clock which swarmed with tumbling cherubs The wallpaper of the room was dark red with gold figures and the woodwork was white pretty and clean The paintings on the wall were largely preoccupied with the amazing heroism of large dogs faced with imperiled children Nor water nor fire nor earthquake could do in a child so long as a big dog was available
	Beside the fireplace old Doctor Winter sat bearded and simple and benign historian and physician to the town He watched in amazement while his thumbs rolled over and over on his lap Doctor Winter was a man so simple that only a profound man would know him as profound He looked up at Joseph the Mayors servingman to see whether Joseph had observed the rolling wonders of his thumbs
	Eleven oclock Doctor Winter asked
	And Joseph answered abstractedly Yes sir The note said eleven
	You read the note
	No sir His Excellency read the note to me
	And Joseph went about testing each of the gilded chairs to see whether it had moved since he had last placed it Joseph habitually scowled at furniture expecting it to be impertinent mischievous or dusty In a world where Mayor Orden was the leader of men Joseph was the leader of furniture silver and dishes Joseph was elderly and lean and serious and his life was so complicated that only a profound man would know him to be simple He saw nothing amazing about Doctor Winters rolling thumbs in fact he found them irritating Joseph suspected that something pretty important was happening what with foreign soldiers in the town and the local army killed or captured Sooner or later Joseph would have to get an opinion about it all He wanted no levity no rolling thumbs no nonsense from furniture Doctor Winter moved his chair a few inches from its appointed place and Joseph waited impatiently for the moment when he could put it back again
	Doctor Winter repeated Eleven oclock and theyll be here then too A timeminded people Joseph
	And Joseph said without listening Yes sir
	A timeminded people the doctor repeated
	Yes sir said Joseph
	Time and machines
	Yes sir
	They hurry toward their destiny as though it would not wait They push the rolling world along with their shoulders
	And Joseph said Quite right sir simply because he was getting tired of saying yes sir
	Joseph did not approve of this line of conversation since it did not help him to have an opinion about anything If Joseph remarked to the cook later in the day A timeminded people Annie it would not make any sense Annie would ask Who and then Why and finally say Thats nonsense Joseph
	Joseph had tried carrying Doctor Winters remarks belowstairs before and it had always ended the same Annie always discovered them to be nonsense
	Doctor Winter looked up from his thumbs and watched Joseph disciplining the chairs Whats the Mayor doing 
	Dressing to receive the colonel sir 
	And you arent helping him He will be ill dressed by himself 
	Madame is helping him Madame wants him to look his best SheJoseph blushed a littleMadame is trimming the hair out of his ears sir It tickles He wont let me do it 
	Of course it tickles said Doctor Winter
	Madame insists said Joseph
	Doctor Winter laughed suddenly He stood up and held his hands to the fire and Joseph skillfully darted behind him and replaced the chair where it should be
	We are so wonderful the doctor said Our country is falling our town is conquered the Mayor is about to receive the conqueror and Madame is holding the struggling Mayor by the neck and trimming the hair out of his ears
	He was getting very shaggy said JosephHis eyebrows too His Excellency is even more upset about having his eyebrows trimmed than his ears He says it hurts I doubt if even Madame can do it
	She will try Doctor Winter said
	She wants him to look his best sir 
	Through the glass window of the entrance door a helmeted face looked in and there was a rapping on the door It seemed that some warm light went out of the room and a little grayness took its place
	Doctor Winter looked up at the clock and said They are early Let them in Joseph 
	Joseph went to the door and opened it A soldier stepped in dressed in a long coat He was helmeted and he carried a submachine gun over his arm He glanced quickly about and then stepped aside
	Behind him an officer stood in the doorway The officers uniform was common and it had rank showing only on the shoulders
	The officer stepped inside and looked at Doctor Winter He was rather like an overdrawn picture of an English gentleman He had a slouch his face was red his nose long but rather pleasing he seemed about as unhappy in his uniform as most British general officers are He stood in the doorway staring at Doctor Winter and he said Are you Mayor Orden sir
	Doctor Winter smiled No no I am not 
	You are an official then 
	No I am the town doctor and I am a friend of the Mayor 
	The officer said Where is Mayor Orden 
	Dressing to receive you You are the colonel 
	No I am not I am Captain Bentick He bowed and Doctor Winter returned the bow slightly Captain Bentick continued as though a little embarrassed at what he had to say Our military regulations sir prescribe that we search for weapons before the commanding officer enters a room We mean no disrespect sir And he called over his shoulder Sergeant
	The sergeant moved quickly to Joseph ran his hands over his pockets and said Nothing sir
	Captain Bentick said to Doctor Winter I hope you will pardon us And the sergeant went to Doctor Winter and patted his pockets His hands stopped at the inside coat pocket He reached quickly in brought out a little flat black leather case and took it to Captain Bentick Captain Bentick opened the case and found there a few simple surgical instrumentstwo scalpels some surgical needles some clamps a hypodermic needle He closed the case again and handed it back to Doctor Winter
	Doctor Winter said yousee I am a country doctor One time I had to perform an appendectomy with a kitchen knife I have always carried these with me since then
	Captain Bentick said I believe there are some firearms here He opened a little leather book that he carried in his pocket
	Doctor Winter said You are thorough
	Yes our local man has been working here for some time
	Doctor Winter said I dont suppose you would tell who that man is
	Bentick said His work is all done now I dont suppose there would be any harm in telling His name is Corell
	And Doctor Winter said in astonishment George Corell Why that seems impossible Hes done a lot for this town Why he even gave prizes for the shootingmatch in the hills this morning And as he said it his eyes began to understand what had happened and his mouth closed slowly and he said I see that is why he gave the shootingmatch Yes I see But George Corellthat sounds impossible
	The door to the left opened and Mayor Orden came in he was digging in his right ear with his little finger He was dressed in his official morning coat with his chain of office about his neck He had a large white spraying mustache and two smaller ones one over each eye His white hair was so recently brushed that only now were the hairs struggling to be free to stand up again He had been Mayor so long that he was the IdeaMayor in the town Even grown people when they saw the word mayor printed or written saw Mayor Orden in their minds He and his office were one It had given him dignity and he had given it warmth
	From behind him Madame emerged small and wrinkled and fierce She considered that she had created this man out of whole cloth had thought him up and she was sure that she could do a better job if she had it to do again Only once or twice in her life had she ever understood all of him but the part of him which she knew she knew intricately and well No little appetite or pain no carelessness or meanness in him escaped her no thought or dream or longing in him ever reached her And yet several times in her life she had seen the stars
	She stepped around the Mayor and she took his hand and pulled his finger out of his outraged ear and pushed his hand to his side the way she would take a babys thumb away from his mouth
	I dont believe for a moment it hurts as much as you say she said and to Doctor Winter He wont let me fix his eyebrows
	It hurts said Mayor Orden
	Very well if you want to look like that there is nothing I can do about it She straightened his already straight tie Im glad youre here Doctor she said How many do you think will come And then she looked up and saw Captain Bentick Oh she said the colonel
	Captain Bentick said No maam Im only preparing for the colonel Sergeant
	The sergeant who had been turning over pillows looking behind pictures came quickly to Mayor Orden and ran his hands over his pockets
	Captain Bentick said Excuse him sir its regulations
	He glanced again at the little book in his hand Your Excellency I think you have firearms here Two items I believe
	Mayor Orden said Firearms Guns you mean I guess Yes I have a shotgun and a sportingrifle He said deprecatingly You know I dont hunt very much any more I always think Im going to and then the season opens and I dont get out I dont take the pleasure in it I used to
	Captain Bentick insisted Where are these guns Your Excellency
	The Mayor rubbed his cheek and tried to think Why I think He turned to Madame Werent they in the back of that cabinet in the bedroom with the walking sticks
	Madame said Yes and every stitch of clothing in that cabinet smells of oil I wish youd put them somewhere else
	Captain Bentick said Sergeant and the sergeant went quickly into the bedroom
	Its an unpleasant duty Im sorry said the captain
	The sergeant came back carrying a doublebarreled shotgun and a rather nice sportingrifle with a shoulder strap He leaned them against the side of the entrance door
	Captain Bentick said Thats all thank you Your Excellency Thank you Madame 
	He turned and bowed slightly to Doctor Winter Thank you Doctor Colonel Lanser will be here directly Good morning 
	And he went out of the front door followed by the sergeant with the two guns in one hand and the submachine gun over his right arm
	Madame said For a moment I thought he was the colonel He was a rather nicelooking young man 
	Doctor Winter said sardonically No he was just protecting the colonel 
	Madame was thinking I wonder how many officers will come And she looked at Joseph and saw that he was shamelessly eavesdropping She shook her head at him and frowned and he went back to the little things he had been doing He began dusting all over again
	And Madame said How many do you think will come 
	Doctor Winter pulled out a chair outrageously and sat down again I dont know he said
	Wellshe frowned at Josephweve been talking it over Should we offer them tea or a glass of wine If we do I dont know how many there will be and if we dont what are we to do 
	Doctor Winter shook his head and smiled I dont know Its been so long since we conquered anybody or anybody conquered us I dont know what is proper 
	Mayor Orden had his finger back in his itching ear He said Well I dont think we should I dont think the people would like it I dont want to drink wine with them I dont know why 
	Madame appealed to the doctor then Didnt people in the old daysthe leaders that iscompliment each other and take a glass of wine
	Doctor Winter nodded Yes indeed they did He shook his head slowly Maybe that was different
	Kings and princes played at war the way Englishmen play at hunting When the fox was dead they gathered at a hunt breakfast But Mayor Orden is probably right the people might not like him to drink wine with the invader
	Madame said The people are down listening to the music Annie told me If they can do that why shouldnt we keep civilized procedure alive
	The Mayor looked steadily at her for a moment and his voice was sharp Madame I think with your permission we will not have wine The people are confused now They have lived at peace so long that they do not quite believe in war They will learn and then they will not be confused any more They elected me not to be confused Six town boys were murdered this morning I think we will have no hunt breakfast The people do not fight wars for sport
	Madame bowed slightly There had been a number of times in her life when her husband had become the Mayor She had learned not to confuse the Mayor with her husband
	Mayor Orden looked at his watch and when Joseph came in carrying a small cup of black coffee he took it absentmindedly Thank you he said and he sipped it I should be clear he said apologetically to Doctor Winter I should bedo you know how many men the invader has 
	Not many the doctor said I dont think over two hundred and fifty but all with those little machine guns 
	The Mayor sipped his coffee again and made a new start What about the rest of the country 
	The doctor raised his shoulders and dropped them again
	Was there no resistance anywhere the Mayor went on hopelessly
	And again the doctor raised his shoulders I dont know The wires are cut or captured There is no news 
	And our boys our soldiers 
	I dont know said the doctor
	Joseph interrupted I heardthat is Annie heard 
	What Joseph 
	Six men were killed sir by the machine guns Annie heard three were wounded and captured 
	But there were twelve 
	Annie heard that three escaped 
	The Mayor turned sharply Which ones escaped he demanded
	I dont know sir Annie didnt hear 
	Madame inspected a table for dust with her finger She said Joseph when they come stay close to your bell We might want some little thing And put on your other coat Joseph the one with the buttons
	She thought for a momentAnd Joseph when you finish what you are told to do go out of the room It makes a bad impression when you just stand around listening Its provincial thats what it is
	Yes Madame Joseph said
	We wont serve wine Joseph but you might have some cigarettes handy in that little silver conserve box And dont strike the match to light the colonels cigarette on your shoe Strike it on the matchbox 
	Yes Madame 
	Mayor Orden unbuttoned his coat and took out his watch and looked at it and put it back and buttoned his coat again one button too high Madame went to him and rebuttoned it correctly
	Doctor Winter asked What time is it 
	Five of eleven 
	A timeminded people the doctor said They will be here on time Do you want me to go away 
	Mayor Orden looked startled Go Nono stay He laughed softly Im a little afraid he said apologetically Well not afraid but Im nervous And he said helplessly We have never been conquered for a long time He stopped to listen In the distance there was a sound of band music a march They all turned in its direction and listened
	Madame said Here they come I hope not too many try to crowd in here at once It isnt a very big room
	Doctor Winter said sardonically Madame would prefer the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles 
	She pinched her lips and looked about already placing the conquerors with her mind It is a very small room she said
	The band music swelled a little and then grew fainter There came a gentle tap on the door
	Now who can that be Joseph if it is anyone tell him to come back later We are very busy
	The tap came again Joseph went to the door and opened it a crack and then a little wider A gray figure helmeted and gauntleted appeared Colonel Lanser s compliments the head said Colonel Lanser requests an audience with Your Excellency
	Joseph opened the door wide The helmeted orderly stepped inside and looked quickly about the room and then stood aside Colonel Lanser he announced
	A second helmeted figure walked into the room and his rank showed only on his shoulders Behind him came a rather short man in a black business suit The colonel was a middleaged man gray and hard and tiredlooking He had the square shoulders of a soldier but his eyes lacked the blank look of the ordinary soldier The little man beside him was bold and rosycheeked with small black eyes and a sensual mouth
	Colonel Lanser took off his helmet With a quick bow he said Your Excellency He bowed to MadameMadame And he said Close the door please Corporal Joseph quickly shut the door and stared in small triumph at the soldier
	Lanser looked questioningly at the doctor and Mayor Orden said This is Doctor Winter 
	An official the colonel asked
	A doctor sir and I might say the local historian 
	Lanser bowed slightly He said Doctor Winter I do not mean to be impertinent but there will be a page in your history perhaps 
	And Doctor Winter smiledMany pages perhaps 
	Colonel Lanser turned slightly toward his companion I think you know Mr Corell he said
	The Mayor said George Corell Of course I know him How are you George 
	Doctor Winter cut in sharply He said very formally Your Excellency our friend George Corell prepared this town for the invasion Our benefactor George Corell sent our soldiers into the hills Our dinner guest George Corell has made a list of every firearm in the town Our friend George Corell 
	Corell said angrily I work for what I believe in That is an honorable thing 
	Ordens mouth hung a little open He was bewildered He looked helplessly from Winter to Corell This isnt true he said George this isnt true You have sat at my table you have drunk port with me Why you helped me plan the hospital This isnt true 
	He was looking very steadily at Corell and Corell looked belligerently back at him There was a long silence Then the Mayors face grew slowly tight and very formal and his whole body was rigid He turned to Colonel Lanser and he said I do not wish to speak in this gentlemans company 
	Corell said I have a right to be here I am a soldier like the rest I simply do not wear a uniform The Mayor repeated I do not wish to speak in this gentlemans presence
	Colonel Lanser said Will you leave us now Mr Corell
	And Corell said I have a right to be here
	Lanser repeated sharply Will you leave us now Mr Corell Do you outrank me
	Well no sir
	Please go Mr Corell said Colonel Lanser
	And Corell looked at the Mayor angrily and then he turned and went quickly out of the doorway
	Doctor Winter chuckled and said Thats good enough for a paragraph in my history Colonel Lanser glanced sharply at him but he did not speak
	Now the door on the right opened and strawhaired redeyed Annie put an angry face into the doorway Theres soldierson the back porch Madame she saidJust standing there 
	They wont come in Colonel Lanser said Its only military procedure 
	Madame said icily Annie if you have anything to say let Joseph bring the message 
	I didnt know but theyd try to get in Annie said They smelled the coffee 
	Annie 
	Yes Madame and she withdrew
	The colonel said May I sit down And he explained We have been a long time without sleep 
	The Mayor seemed to start out of sleep himself yes he said of course sit down 
	The colonel looked at Madame and she seated herself and he settled tiredly into a chair Mayor Orden stood still half dreaming
	The colonel began We want to get along as well as we can You see sir this is more like a business venture than anything else We need the coal mine here and the fishing We will try to get along with just as little friction as possible
	The Mayor said I have had no news What about the rest of the country
	All taken said the colonel It was well planned
	Was there no resistance anywhere
	The colonel looked at him compassionately I wish there had not been Yes there was some resistance but it only caused bloodshed We had planned very carefully
	Orden stuck to his point But there was resistance
	Yes but it was foolish to resist Just as here it was destroyed instantly It was sad and foolish to resist
	Doctor Winter caught some of the Mayors anxiousness about the point Yes he said foolish but they resisted
	And Colonel Lanser replied Only a few and they are gone The people as a whole are quiet
	Doctor Winter said The people dont know yet what has happened
	They are discovering said Lanser They wont be foolish again He cleared his throat and his voice became brisk Now sir I must get to business Im really very tired but before I can sleep I must make my arrangements He sat forward in his chair I am more engineer than soldier This whole thing is more an engineering job than conquest The coal must come out of the ground and be shipped We have technicians but the local people will continue to work the mine Is that clear We do not wish to be harsh
	And Orden said Yes thats clear enough But suppose the people do not want to work the mine
	The colonel said I hope they will want to because they must We must have the coal
	But if they dont 
	They must They are an orderly people They dont want trouble He waited for the Mayors reply and none came Is that not so sir the colonel asked
	Mayor Orden twisted his chain I dont know sir They are orderly under their own government
	I dont know how they would be under yours It is untouched ground you see We have built our government over four hundred years 
	The colonel said quickly We know that and so we are going to keep your government You will still be the Mayor you will give the orders you will penalize and reward In that way they will not give trouble
	Mayor Orden looked at Doctor Winter What are you thinking about 
	I dont know said Doctor Winter It would be interesting to see Id expect trouble This might be a bitter people 
	Mayor Orden said I dont know either He turned to the colonel Sir I am of this people and yet I dont know what they will do Perhaps you know Some people accept appointed leaders and obey them But my people have elected me They made me and they can unmake me Perhaps they will if they think I have gone over to you I just dont know
	The colonel said You will be doing them a service if you keep them in order 
	A service 
	Yes a service It is your duty to protect them from harm They will be in danger if they are rebellious
	We must get the coal you see Our leaders do not tell us how they order us to get it But you have your people to protect You must make them do the work and thus keep them safe 
	Mayor Orden asked Butsuppose they dont want to be safe 
	Then you must think for them 
	Orden said a little proudly My people dont like to have others think for them Maybe they are different from your people I am confused but that I am sure of 
	Now Joseph came in quickly and he stood leaning forward bursting to speak Madame said What is it Joseph Get the silver box of cigarettes
	Pardon Madame said Joseph Pardon Your Excellency
	What do you want the Mayor asked
	Its Annie he said Shes getting angry sir
	What is the matter Madame demanded
	Annie doesnt like the soldiers on the back porch
	The colonel asked Are they causing trouble 
	They are looking through the door at Annie said Joseph She hates that 
	The colonel said They are carrying out orders They are doing no harm 
	Well Annie hates to be stared at said Joseph
	Madame said Joseph tell Annie to take care 
	Yes Madame and Joseph went out
	The colonels eyes dropped with tiredness Theres another thing Your Excellency he said Would it be possible for me and my staff to stay here
	Mayor Orden thought a moment and he said Its a small place There are larger more comfortable places
	Then Joseph came back with the silver box of cigarettes and he opened it and held it in front of the colonel When the colonel took one Joseph ostentatiously lighted it The colonel puffed deeply
	It isnt that he said We have found that when a staff lives under the roof of the local authority there is more tranquility
	You mean said Orden the people feel there is collaboration involved
	Yes I suppose that is it
	Mayor Orden looked hopelessly at Doctor Winter and Winter could offer him nothing but a wry smile
	Orden said softly Am I permitted to refuse this honor
	Im sorry the colonel said No These are the orders of my leader
	The people will not like it Orden said
	Always the people The people are disarmed The people have no say
	Mayor Orden shook his head You do not know sir
	From the doorway came the sound of an angry womans voice and a thump and a mans cry Joseph came scuttling through the door Shes thrown boiling water Joseph said Shes very angry
	There were commands through the door and the clump of feet Colonel Lanser got up heavily Have you no control over your servants sir he asked
	Mayor Orden smiled Very little he said Shes a good cook when she is happy Was anyone hurt he asked Joseph
	The water was boiling sir



CHAPTER II

Upstairs in the little palace of the Mayor the staff of Colonel Lanser made its headquarters There were five of them besides the colonel There was Major Hunter a haunted little man of figures a little man who being a dependable unit considered all other men either as dependable units or as unfit to live
	Major Hunter was an engineer and except in case of war no one would have thought of giving him command of men For Major Hunter set his men in rows like figures and he added and subtracted and multiplied them He was an arithmetician rather than a mathematician None of the humor the music or the mysticism of higher mathematics ever entered his head Men might vary in height or weight or color just as 6 is different from 8 but there was little other difference He had been married several times and he did not know why his wives became very nervous before they left him
	Captain Bentick was a family man a lover of dogs and pink children and Christmas He was too old to be a captain but a curious lack of ambition had kept him in that rank Before the war he had admired the British country gentleman very much wore English clothes kept English dogs smoked in an English pipe a special pipe mixture sent him from London and subscribed to those country magazines which extol gardening and continually argue about the relative merits of English and Gordon setters Captain Bentick spent all his holidays in Sussex and liked to be mistaken for an Englishman in Budapest or Paris The war changed all that outwardly but he had sucked on a pipe too long had carried a stick too long to give them up too suddenly Once five years before he had written a letter to the Times about grass dying in the Midlands and had signed it Edmund Twitchell Esq and furthermore the Times had printed it
	If Captain Bentick was too old to be a captain Captain Loft was too young Captain Loft was as much a captain as one can imagine He lived and breathed his captaincy He had no unmilitary moments A driving ambition forced him up through the grades He rose like cream to the top of milk He clicked his heels as perfectly as a dancer does He knew every kind of military courtesy and insisted on using it all
	Generals were afraid of him because he knew more about the deportment of a soldier than they did
	Captain Loft thought and believed that a soldier is the highest development of animal life If he considered God at all he thought of Him as an old and honored general retired and gray living among remembered battles and putting wreaths on the graves of his lieutenants several times a year Captain Loft believed that all women fall in love with a uniform and he did not see how it could be otherwise In the normal course of events he would be a brigadiergeneral at fortyfive and have his picture in the illustrated papers flanked by tall pale masculine women wearing lacy picture hats
	Lieutenants Prackle and Tonder were snotnoses undergraduates lieutenants trained in the politics of the day believing the great new system invented by a genius so great that they never bothered to verify its results They were sentimental young men given to tears and to furies Lieutenant Prackle carried a lock of hair in the back of his watch wrapped in a bit of blue satin and the hair was constantly getting loose and clogging the balance wheel so that he wore a wrist watch for telling time Prackle was a dancingpartner a gay young man who nevertheless could scowl like the Leader could brood like the Leader He hated degenerate art and had destroyed several canvases with his own hands In cabarets he sometimes made pencil sketches of his companions which were so good that he had often been told he should have been an artist Prackle had several blond sisters of whom he was so proud that he had on occasion caused a commotion when he thought they had been insulted The sisters were a little disturbed about it because they were afraid someone might set out to prove the insults which would not have been hard to do Lieutenant Prackle spent nearly all his time off duty daydreaming of seducing Lieutenant Tonders blond sister a buxom girl who loved to be seduced by older men who did not muss her hair as Lieutenant Prackle did
	Lieutenant Tonder was a poet a bitter poet who dreamed of perfect ideal love of elevated young men for poor girls Tonder was a dark romantic with a vision as wide as his experience He sometimes spoke blank verse under his breath to imaginary dark women He longed for death on the battlefield with weeping parents in the background and the Leader brave but sad in the presence of the dying youth He imagined his death very often lighted by a fair setting sun which glinted on broken military equipment his men standing silently around him with heads sunk low as over a fat cloud galloped the Valkyries bigbreasted mothers and mistresses in one while Wagnerian thunder crashed in the background And he even had his dying words ready
	These were the men of the staff each one playing war as children play Run Sheep Run Major Hunter thought of war as an arithmetical job to be done so he could get back to his fireplace Captain Loft as the proper career of a properly broughtup young man and Lieutenants Prackle and Tonder as a dreamlike thing in which nothing was very real And their war so far had been playfine weapons and fine planning against unarmed planless enemies They had lost no fights and suffered little hurt They were under pressure capable of cowardice or courage as everyone is Of them all only Colonel Lanser knew what war really is in the long run
	Lanser had been in Belgium and France twenty years before and he tried not to think what he knewthatwar is treachery and hatred the muddling of incompetent generals the torture and killing and sickness and tiredness until at last it is over and nothing has changed except for new weariness and new hatreds Lanser told himself he was a soldier given orders to carry out He was not expected to question or to think but only to carry out orders and he tried to put aside the sick memories of the other war and the certainty that this would be the same This one will be different he said to himself fifty times a day this one will be very different
	In marching in mobs in football games and in war outlines become vague real things become unreal and a fog creeps over the mind Tension and excitement weariness movementall merge in one great gray dream so that when it is over it is hard to remember how it was when you killed men or ordered them to be killed Then other people who were not there tell you what it was like and you say vaguely Yes I guess thats how it was
	This staff had taken three rooms on the upper floor of the Mayors palace In the bedrooms they had put their cots and blankets and equipment and in the room next to them and directly over the little drawingroom on the ground floor they had made a kind of club rather an uncomfortable club There were a few chairs and a table Here they wrote letters and read letters They talked and ordered coffee and planned and tested On the walls between the windows there were pictures of cows and lakes and little farmhouses and from the windows they could look down over the town to the waterfront to the docks where the shipping was tied up to the docks where the coal barges pulled up and took their loads and went out to sea They could look down over the little town that twisted past the square to the waterfront and they could see the fishingboats lying at anchor in the bay the sails furled and they could smell the drying fish on the beach right through the window
	There was a large table in the center of the room and Major Hunter sat beside it He had his drawingboard in his lap and resting on the table and with a Tsquare and triangle he worked at a design for a new railroad siding The drawingboard was unsteady and the major was growing angry with its unsteadiness He called over his shoulder PrackleAnd then Lieutenant Prackle
	The bedroom door opened and the lieutenant came out half his face covered with shavingcream He held the brush in his hand Yes he said
	Major Hunter jiggled his drawingboard Hasnt that tripod for my board turned up in the baggage
	I dont know sir said Prackle I didnt look
	Well look now will you Its bad enough to have to work in this light Ill have to draw this again before I ink it
	Prackle said Just as soon as I finish shaving Ill look
	Hunter said irritably This siding is more important than your looks See if there is a canvas case like a golf bag under that pile in there
	Prackle disappeared into the bedroom The door to the right opened and Captain Loft came in He wore his helmet a pair of field glasses sidearm and various little leather cases strung all over him He began to remove his equipment as soon as he entered
	You know that Benticks crazy he said He was going out on duty in a fatigue cap right down the street
	Loft put his field glasses on the table and took off his helmet then his gasmask bag A little pile of equipment began to heap up on the table
	Hunter said Dont leave that stuff there I have to work here Why shouldnt he wear a cap There hasnt been any trouble I get sick of these tin things Theyre heavy and you cant see
	Loft said primly Itsbad practice to leave it off Its bad for the people here We must maintain a military standard an alertness and never vary it Well just invite trouble if we dont
	What makes you think so Hunter asked Loft drew himself up a little His mouth thinned with certainty Sooner or later everyone wanted to punch Loft in the nose for his sureness about things He said I dont think it I was paraphrasing Manual X12 on deportment in occupied countries It is very carefully worked out He began to say You and then changed it to Everybody should read X12 very closely
	Hunter said I wonder whether the man who wrote it was ever in occupied country These people are harmless enough They seem to be good obedient people
	Prackle came through the door his face still half covered with shavingsoap He carried a brown canvas tube and behind him came Lieutenant Tonder Is this it Prackle asked
	Yes Unpack it will you and set it up 
	Prackle and Tonder went to work on the folding tripod and tested it and put it near Hunter The major screwed his board to it tilted it right and left and finally settled gruntingly behind it
	Captain Loft said Do you know you have soap on your face Lieutenant 
	Yes sir Prackle said I was shaving when the major asked me to get the tripod 
	Well you had better get it off Loft said The colonel might see you 
	Oh he wouldnt mind He doesnt care about things like that
	Tonder was looking over Hunters shoulder as he worked
	Loft said Well he may not but it doesnt look right
	Prackle took a handkerchief and rubbed the soap from his cheek Tonder pointed to a little drawing on the corner of the majors board Thats a nicelooking bridge Major But where in the world are we going to build a bridge
	Hunter looked down at the drawing and then over his shoulder at Tonder Huh Oh that isnt any bridge were going to build Up here is the work drawing
	What are you doing with a bridge then
	Hunter seemed a little embarrassed Well you know in my back yard at home Ive got a model railroad line I was going to bridge a little creek for it Brought the line right down to the creek but I never did get the bridge built I thought Id kind of work it out while I was away
	Lieutenant Prackle took from his pocket a folded rotogravure page and he unfolded it and held it up and looked at it It was a picture of a girl all legs and dress and eyelashes a welldeveloped blonde in black openwork stockings and a low bodice and this particular blonde peeped over a black lace fan
	Lieutenant Prackle held her up and he said Isnt she something Lieutenant Tonder looked critically at the picture and said I dont like her
	What dont you like about her
	I just dont like her said Tonder What do you want her picture for
	Prackle said Because I do like her and I bet you do too
	I do not said Tonder
	You mean to say you wouldnt take a date with her if you could Prackle asked
	Tonder said No
	Well youre justcrazy and Prackle went to one of the curtains He said Im just going to stick her up here and let you brood about her for a while He pinned the picture to the curtain
	Captain Loft was gathering his equipment into his arms now and he said I dont think it looks very well out here Lieutenant Youd better take it down It wouldnt make a good impression on the local people
	Hunter looked up from his board What wouldnt He followed their eyes to the picture Whos that he asked
	Shes an actress said Prackle
	Hunter looked at her carefully Oh do you know her
	Tonder said Shes a tramp
	Hunter said Oh then you know her
	Prackle was looking steadily at Tonder He said Say how do you know shes a tramp
	She looks like a tramp said Tonder
	Do you know her
	No and I dont want to
	Prackle began to say Then how do you know when Loft broke in He said Youd better take the picture down Put it up over your bed if you want to This rooms kind of official here
	Prackle looked at him mutinously and was about to speak when Captain Loft said Thats an order Lieutenant and poor Prackle folded his paper and put it into his pocket again He tried cheerily to change the subject There are some pretty girls in this town all right he said As soon as we get settled down and everything going smoothly Im going to get acquainted with a few
	Loft said Youd better read X12 Theres a section dealing with sexual matters And he went out carrying his duffel glasses and equipment Lieutenant Tonder still looking over Hunters shoulder said Thats cleverthe coal cars come right through the mines to the ship
	Hunter came slowly out of his work and he said We have to speed it up weve got to get that coal moving Its a big job Im awful thankful that the people here are calm and sensible
	Loft came back into the room without his equipment He stood by the window looking out toward the harbor toward the coal mine and he said They are calm and sensible because we are calm and sensible I think we can take credit for that Thats why I keep harping on procedure It is very carefully worked out
	The door opened and Colonel Lanser came in removing his coat as he entered His staff gave him military courtesynot very rigid but enough Lanser said Captain Loft will you go down and relieve Bentick He isnt feeling well says hes dizzy
	Yes sir  said Loft May I suggest sir that I only recently came off duty
	Lanser inspected him closely I hope you dont mind going Captain
	Not at all sir I just mention it for the record
	Lanser relaxed and chuckled You like to be mentioned in the reports dont you
	It does no harm sir
	And when you have enough mentions Lanser went on there will be a little dangler on your chest
	They are the milestones in a military career sir Lanser sighed Yes I guess they are But they wont be the ones youll remember Captain
	SirLoft asked
	Youll know what I mean laterperhaps 
	Captain Loft put his equipment on rapidly Yes sir he said and went out and his footsteps clattered down the wooden stairs and Lanser watched him go with a little amusement He said quietly There goes a born soldier And Hunter looked up and poised his pencil and he said A born ass
	No said Lanser hes being a soldier the way a lot of men would be politicians Hell be on the General Staff before long Hell look down on war from above and so hell always love it
	Lieutenant Prackle said When do you think the war will be over sir 
	Over Over What do you mean 
	Lieutenant Prackle continued How soon will we win 
	Lanser shook his head Oh I dont know The enemy is still in the world 
	But we will lick them said Prackle
	Lanser said Yes 
	Wont we 
	Yes yes we always do 
	Prackle said excitedly Well if its quiet around Christmas do you think there will be some furloughs granted 
	I dont know said Lanser Such orders will have to come from home Do you want to get home for Christmas
	Well Id kind of like to
	Maybe you will said Lanser maybe you will
	Lieutenant Tonder said We wont drop out of this occupation will we sir after the war is over
	I dont know said the colonel Why
	Well said Tonder its a nice country nice people Our mensome of themmight even settle here Lanser said jokingly Youve seen some place you like perhaps
	Well said Tonder there are some beautiful farms here If four or five of them were thrown together it would be a nice place to settle I think
	You have no family land then Lanser asked
	No sir not any more Inflation took it away
	Lanser was tired now of talking to children He said Ah well we still have a war to fight We still have coal to take out Do you suppose we can wait until it is over before we build up these estates Such orders will come from above Captain Loft can tell you that His manner changed He said Hunter your steel will be in tomorrow You can get your tracks started this week
	There was a knock at the door and a sentry put his head in He said Mr Corell wishes to see you sir
	Send him in said the colonel And he said to the others This is the man who did the preliminary work here We might have some trouble with him
	Did be do a good job Tonder asked
	Yes he did and he wont be popular with the people here I wonder whether he will be popular with us
	He deserves credit certainly Tonder said
	Yes Lanser said and dont think he wont claim it
	Corell came in rubbing his hands He radiated goodwill and goodfellowship He was dressed still in his black business suit but on his head there was a patch of white bandage stuck to his hair with a cross of adhesive tape He advanced to the center of the room and said Good morning Colonel I should have called yesterday after the trouble downstairs but I knew how busy you would be
	The colonel said Good morningThen with a circular gesture of his hand This is my staff Mr
	Corell
	Fine boys said Corell They did a good job Well I tried to prepare for them well
	Hunter looked down at his board and he took out an inkingpen and dipped it and began to ink in his drawing
	Lanser said You did very well I wish you hadnt killed those six men though I wish their soldiers hadnt come back
	Corell spread his hands and said comfortably Six men is a small loss for a town of this size with a coal mine too
	Lanser said sternly I am not averse to killing people if that finishes it But sometimes it is better not to
	Corell had been studying the officers He looked sideways at the lieutenants and he said Could weperhapstalkalone Colonel
	Yes if you wish Lieutenant Prackle and Tonder will you go to your room please And the colonel said to Corell Major Hunter is working He doesnt hear anything when hes working Hunter looked up from his board and smiled quietly and looked down again The young lieutenants left the room and when they were gone Lanser said Well here we are Wont you sit down
	Thank you sir and Corell sat down behind the table
	Lanser looked at the bandage on Corells head He said bluntly Have they tried to kill you already
	Corell felt the bandage with his fingers This Oh this was a stone that fell from a cliff in the hill this morning
	Youre sure it wasnt thrown 
	What do you mean Corell asked These arent fierce people They havent had a war for a hundred years Theyve forgotten about fighting 
	Well youve lived among them said the colonel You ought to know He stepped close to Corell
	But if you are safe these people are different from any in the world Ive helped to occupy countries before I was in Belgium twenty years ago and in France He shook his head a little as though to clearit and he said gruffly You did a good job We should thank you I mentioned your work in my report
	Thank you sir said Corell I did my best 
	Lanser said a little wearily Well sir now what shall we do Would you like to go back to the capital
	We can put you on a coal barge if youre in ahurry or on a destroyer if you want to wait 
	Corell said But I dont want to go back Ill stay here 
	Lanser studied this for a moment and he said youknow I havent a great many men I cant give you a very adequate bodyguard 
	But I dont need a bodyguard I tell you these arent violent people 
	Lanser looked at the bandage for a moment Hunter glanced up from his board and remarked Youd better start wearing a helmet He looked down at his work again
	Now Corell moved forward in his chair I wanted particularly to talk to you Colonel I thought I might help with the civil administration 
	Lanser turned on his heel and walked to the window and looked out and then he swung around and said quietly What have you in mind 
	Well you must have a civil authority you can trust I thought perhaps that Mayor Orden might step down now andwell if I were to take over his office it and the military would work very nicely together 
	Lansers eyes seemed to grow large and bright He came close to Corell and he spoke sharply Have you mentioned this in your report 
	Corell said Well yes naturallyin my analysis 
	Lanser interrupted Have you talked to any of the town people since we arrivedoutside of the Mayor that is 
	Well no You see they are still a bit startled They didnt expect it He chuckled No sir they certainly didnt expect it 
	But Lanser pressed his point So you dont really know whats going on in their minds 
	Why theyre startled said Corell Theyrewell theyre almost dreaming 
	You dont know what they think of you Lanser asked
	I have many friends here I know everyone 
	Did anyone buy anything in your store this morning 
	Well of course business is at a standstill Corell answered No ones buying anything 
	Lanser relaxed suddenly He went to a chair and sat down and crossed his legs He said quietly Yours is a difficult and brave branch of the service It should be greatly rewarded 
	Thank you sir 
	You will have their hatred in time said the colonel
	I can stand that sir They are the enemy 
	Now Lanser hesitated a long moment before he spoke and then he said softly you will not even have our respect
	Corell jumped to his feet excitedly This is contrary to the Leaders words he said The Leader has said that all branches are equally honorable
	Lanser went on very quietly I hope the Leader knows I hope he can read the minds of soldiers And then almost compassionately he said You should be greatly rewarded For a moment he sat quietly and then he pulled himself together and said Now we must come to exactness I am in charge here My job is to get coal out To do that I must maintain order anddiscipline and to do that I must know what is in the minds of these people I must anticipate revolt Do you understand that
	Well I can find out what you wish to know sir As Mayor here I will be very effective said Corell
	Lanser shook his head I have no orders about this I must use my own judgment I think you will never again know what is going on here I think no one will speak to you no one will be near to you except those people who will live on money who can live on money I think without a guard you will be in great danger It will please me if you go back to the capital there to be rewarded for your fine work
	But my place is here sir said Corell I have made my place It is all in my report 
	Lanser went on as though he had not heard Mayor Orden is more than a mayor he said He is the people He knows what they are doing thinking without asking because he will think what they think
	By watching him I will know them He must stay That is my judgment
	Corell said My work sir merits better treatment than being sent away
	Yes it does Lanser said slowly But to the larger work I think you are only a detriment now If you are not hated yet you will be In any little revolt you will be the first to be killed I think I will suggest that you go back
	Corell said stiffly You will of course permit me to wait for a reply to my report to the capital
	Yes of course But I shall recommend that you go back for your own safety Frankly Mr Corell you have no value here Butwell there must be other plans and other countries Perhaps you will go now to some new town in some new country You will win new confidence in a new field You may be given a larger town even a city a greater responsibility I think I will recommend you highly for your work here
	Corells eyes were shining with gratificationThank you sir he said Ive worked hard Perhaps you are right But you must permit me to wait for the reply from the capital
	Lansers voice was tight His eyes were slitted He said harshly Wear a helmet keep indoors do not go out at night and above all do not drink Trustno woman nor any man Do you understand that
	Corell looked pityingly at the colonel I dont think you understand I have a little house A pleasant country girl waits on me I even think shes a little fond of me These are simple peaceful people I know them
	Lanser said There are no peaceful people When will you learn it There are no friendly people Cant you understand that We have invaded this countryyou by what they call treachery prepared for us
	His face grew red and his voice rose Cant you understand that we are at war with these people
	Corell said a little smugly We have defeated them
	The colonel stood up and swung his arms helplessly and Hunter looked up from his board and put his hand out to protect his board from being jiggled Hunter said Careful now sir Im inking in I wouldnt want to do it all over again
	Lanser looked down at him and said Sorry and went on as though he were instructing a class He said Defeat is a momentary thing A defeat doesnt last We were defeated and now we attack Defeat means nothing Cant you understand that Do you know what they are whispering behind doors
	Corell asked Do you
	No but I suspect
	Then Corell said insinuatingly Are you afraid Colonel Should the commander of this occupation be afraid
	Lanser sat down heavily and said Maybe thats it And he said disgustedly Im tired of people who have not been at war who know all about it He held his chin in his hand and said I remember a little old woman in Brusselssweet face white hair she was only four feet eleven delicate old hands You could see the veins almost black against her skin And her black shawl and her bluewhite hair She used to sing our national songs to us in a quivering sweet voice She always knew where to find a cigarette or a virgin He dropped his hand from his chin and he caught himself as though he had been asleep We didnt know her son had been executed he said When we finally shot her she had killed twelve men with a long black hatpin I have it yet at home It has an enamel button with a bird over it red and blue
	Corell said But you shot her
	Of course we shot her
	And the murders stopped asked Corell
	No the murders did not stop And when we finally retreated the people cut off stragglers and they burned some and they gouged the eyes from some and some they even crucified 
	Corell said loudly These are not good things to say Colonel 
	They are not good things to remember said Lanser
	Corell said You should not be in command if you are afraid 
	And Lanser answered softly I know how to fight you see If you know at least you do not make silly errors 
	Do you talk this way to the young officers Lanser shook his head No they wouldnt believe me 
	Why do you tell me then 
	Because Mr Corell your work is done I remember one time and as he spoke there was a tumble of feet on the stairs and the door burst open A sentry looked in and Captain Loft brushed past him Loft was rigid and cold and military he said Theres trouble sir 
	Trouble 
	I have to report sir that Captain Bentick has been killed 
	Lanser said OhyesBentick 
	There was the sound of a number of footsteps on the stairs and two stretcherbearers came in carrying a figure covered with blankets
	Lanser said Are you sure hes dead 
	Quite sure Loft said stiffly
	The lieutenants came in from the bedroom their mouths a little open and they looked frightened Lanser said Put him down there and he pointed to the wall beside the windows When the bearers had gone Lanser knelt and lifted a corner of the blanket and then quickly put it down again And still kneeling he looked at Loft and said Who did this
	A miner said Loft
	Why 
	I was there sir 
	Well make your report then Make your report damn it man 
	Loft drew himself up and said formally I had just relieved Captain Bentick as the colonel ordered
	Captain Bentick was about to leave to come here when I had some trouble about a recalcitrant miner who wanted to quit work He shouted something about being a free man When I ordered him to work he rushed at me with his pick Captain Bentick tried to interfere He gestured slightly toward the body
	Lanser still kneeling nodded slowly Bentick was a curious man he said He loved the English He loved everything about them I dont think he liked to fight very much You captured the man
	Yes sir Loft said
	Lanser stood up slowly and spoke as though tohimself So it starts again We will shoot this man and make twenty new enemies Its the only thing we know the only thing we know
	Prackle said What do you say sir
	Lanser answered Nothing nothing at all I was just thinking He turned to Loft and said Please give my compliments to Mayor Orden and my request that he see me immediately It is very important
	Major Hunter looked up dried his inkingpen carefully and put it away in a velvetlined box



CHAPTER III

In the town the people moved sullenly through the streets Some of the light of astonishment was gone from their eyes but still a light of anger had not taken its place In the coal shaft the workingmen pushed the coal cars sullenly The small tradesmen stood behind their counters and served the people but no one communicated with them The people spoke to one another in monosyllables and everyone was thinking of the war thinking of himself thinking of the past and how it had suddenly been changed
	In the drawingroom of the palace of Mayor Orden a small fire burned and the lights were on for it was a gray day outside and there was frost in the air The room was itself undergoing a change The tapestrycovered chairs were pushed back the little tables out of the way and through the doorway to the right Joseph and Annie were struggling to bring in a large square diningtable They had it on its side
	Joseph was in the drawingroom and Annies red face showed through the door Joseph maneuvered the legs around sideways and he cried Dont push Annie Now
	I am nowing  said Annie the rednosed the redeyed the angry Annie was always a little angry and these soldiers this occupation did not improve her temper Indeed what for years had been considered simply a bad disposition was suddenly become a patriotic emotion Annie had gained some little reputation as an exponent of liberty by throwing hot water on the soldiers She would have thrown it on anyone who cluttered up her porch but it just happened that she had become a heroine and since anger had been the beginning of her success Annie went on to new successes by whipping herself into increased and constant anger
	Dont scuff the bottom Joseph said The table wedged in the doorway Steady Joseph warned
	I am steady said Annie
	Joseph stood off and studied the table and Annie crossed her arms and glared at him He tested a leg
	Dont push he said Dont push so hard And by himself he got the table through while Annie followed with crossed arms Now up she goes said Joseph and at last Annie helped him settle it on four legs and move it to the center of the room There Annie said If His Excellency hadnt told me to I wouldnt have done it What right have they got moving tables around
	What right coming in at all said Joseph
	None said Annie
	None repeated Joseph I see it like they have no right at all but they do it with their guns and their parachutes they do it Annie
	They got no right said Annie What do they want with a table in here anyway This isnt a diningroom
	Joseph moved a chair up to the table and he set it carefully at the right distance from the table and he adjusted it Theyre going to hold a trial he said Theyre going to try Alexander Morden
	Molly Mordens husband
	Molly Mordens husband
	For bashing that fellow with a pick
	Thats right said Joseph
	But hes a nice man Annie said Theyve got no right to try him He gave Molly a big red dress for her birthday What right have they got to try Alex 
	Well Joseph explained he killed this fellow 
	Suppose he did the fellow ordered Alex around I heard about it Alex doesnt like to be ordered
	Alexs been an alderman in his time and his father too And Molly Morden makes a nice cake Annie said charitably But her frosting gets too hard Whatll they do with Alex 
	Shoot him Joseph said gloomily
	They cant do that 
	Bring up the chairs Annie Yes they can Theyll just do it 
	Annie shook a very rigid finger in his face You remember my words she said angrily People arent going to like it if they hurt Alex People like Alex Did he ever hurt anybody before Answer me that 
	No said Joseph
	Well there you see If they hurt Alex people are going to be mad and Im going to be mad I wont stand for it 
	What will you do Joseph asked her
	Why Ill kill some of them myself said Annie
	And then theyll shoot you said Joseph
	Let them I tell you Joseph things can go too fartramping in and out all hours of the night shooting people
	Joseph adjusted a chair at the head of the table and he became in some curious way a conspirator He said softly Annie
	She paused and sensing his tone walked nearer to him He said Can you keep a secret 
	She looked at him with a little admiration for he had never had a secret before Yes What is it 
	Well William Deal and Walter Doggel got away last night 
	Got away Where 
	They got away to England in a boat 
	Annie sighed with pleasure and anticipation Does everybody know it 
	Well not everybody said Joseph Everybody but and he pointed a quick thumb toward the ceiling
	When did they go Why didnt I hear about it 
	You were busy Josephs voice and face were cold You know that Corell 
	Yes 
	Joseph came close to her I dont think hes going to live long 
	What do you mean Annie asked
	Well people are talking 
	Annie sighed with tensionAhhh 
	Joseph at last had opinions People are getting together he said They dont like to be conquered
	Things are going to happen You keep your eyes peeled Annie Theres going to be things for you to do
	Annie asked How about His Excellency Whats he going to do How does His Excellency stand
	Nobody knows said Joseph He doesnt say anything
	He wouldnt be against us Annie said
	He doesnt say said Joseph
	The knob turned on the lefthand door and Mayor Orden came in slowly He looked tired and old
	Behind him Doctor Winter walked Orden said Thats good Joseph Thank you Annie It looks very well 
	They went out and Joseph looked back through the door for a moment before he closed it
	Mayor Orden walked to the fire and turned to warm his back Doctor Winter pulled out the chair at the head of the table and sat down I wonder how much longer I can hold thisposition  Orden said The people dont quite trust me and neither does the enemy I wonder whether this is a good thing
	I dont know said Winter youtrust yourself dont you Theres no doubt in your own mind
	Doubt No I am the Mayor I dont understand many things He pointed to the table I dont know why they have to hold this trial in here Theyre going to try Alex Morden here for murder You remember Alex He has that pretty little wife Molly
	I remember said Winter She used to teach in the grammar school Yes I remember Shes so pretty she hated to get glasses when she needed them Well I guess Alex killed an officer all right
	Nobodys questioned that
	Mayor Orden said bitterly Nobody questions it But why do they try him Why dont they shoot him
	This is not a matter of doubt or certainty justice or injustice Theres none of that here Why must they try himand in my house
	Winter said I would guess it is for the show Theres an idea about it if you go through the form of a thing you have it and sometimes people are satisfied with the form of a thing We had an armysoldiers with gunsbut it wasntan army you see The invaders will have a trial and hope to convince the people that there is justice involved Alex did kill the captain you know
	Yes I see that Orden said
	And Winter went on If it comes from your house where the people expect justice
	He was interrupted by the opening of the door to the right A young woman entered She was about thirty and quite pretty She carried her glasses in her hand She was dressed simply and neatly and she was very excited She said quickly Annie told me to come right in sir
	Why of course said the Mayor Youre Molly Morden
	Yes sir I am They say that Alex is to be tried and shot
	Orden looked down at the floor for a moment and Molly went on They say you will sentence him It will be your words that send him out
	Orden looked up startled Whats this Who says this
	The people in the townShe held herself very straight and she asked half pleadingly half demandingly You wouldnt do that would you sir
	How could the people know what I dont know he said
	That is a great mystery said Doctor Winter That is a mystery that has disturbed rulers all over the worldhow the people know It disturbs the invaders now I am told how news runs through censorships how the truth of things fights free of control It is a great mystery
	The girl looked up for the room had suddenly darkened and she seemed to be afraid Its a cloud she said Theres word snow is on the way and its early too Doctor Winter went to the window and squinted up at the sky and he said Yes its a big cloud maybe it will pass over
	Mayor Orden switched on a lamp that made only a little circle of light He switched it on again and said A light in the daytime is a lonely thing
	Now Molly came near to him again Alex is not a murdering man she said Hes a quicktempered man but hes never broken a law Hes a respected man
	Orden rested his hand on her shoulder and he said I have known Alex since he was a little boy I knew his father and his grandfather His grandfather was a bearhunter in the old days Did you know that
	Molly ignored him You wouldnt sentence Alex
	No he said How could I sentence him
	The people said you would for the sake of order Mayor Orden stood behind a chair and gripped its back with his hands Do the people want order Molly
	I dont know she said They want to be free
	Well do they know how to go about it Do they know what method to use against an armed enemy
	No Molly said I dont think so
	You are a bright girl Molly do you know
	No sir but I think the people feel that they are beaten if they are docile They want to show these soldiers theyre unbeaten
	Theyve had no chance to fight Its no fight to go against machine guns Doctor Winter said Orden said When you know what they want to do will you tell me Molly
	She looked at him suspiciously Yes she said You mean noYou dont trust me
	But how about Alex she questioned
	Ill not sentence him He has committed no crime against our people said the Mayor
	Molly was hesitant now She said Will theywill they kill Alex
	Orden stared at her and he said Dear child my dear child
	She held herself rigid Thank you
	Orden came close to her and she said weakly Dont touch me Please dont touch me Please dont touch me And his hand dropped For a moment she stood still then she turned stiffly and went out of the door
	She had just closed the door when Joseph entered Excuse me sir the colonel wants to see you I said you were busy I knew she was here And Madame wants to see you too
	Orden said Ask Madame to come in
	Joseph went out and Madame came in immediately
	I dont know how I can run a house she began itsmore people than the house can stand Annies angry all the time
	Hush Orden said
	Madame looked at him in amazement I dont know what
	Hush he said Sarah I want you to go to Alex Mordens house Do you understand I want you to stay with Molly Morden while she needs you Dont talk just stay with her
	Madame said Ive a hundred things
	Sarah I want you to stay with Molly Morden Dont leave her alone Go now
	She comprehended slowly Yes she said Yes I will When will it be over
	I dont know he said Ill send Annie when its time
	She kissed him lightly on the cheek and went out Orden walked to the door and called Joseph Ill see the colonel now
	Lanser came in He had on a new pressed uniform with a little ornamental dagger at the belt He said Good morning Your Excellency I wish to speak to you informally He glanced at Doctor Winter I should like to speak to you alone
	Winter went slowly to the door and as he reached it Orden said Doctor
	Winter turned Yes
	Will you come back this evening
	You will have work for me the doctor asked
	Nono I just wont like to be alone
	I will be here said the doctor
	And Doctor do you think Molly looked all right
	Oh I think so Close to hysteria I guess But shes good stock Shes good strong stock She is a Kenderly you know
	Id forgotten Orden said Yes she is a Kenderly isnt she
	Doctor Winter went out and shut the door gently behind him
	Lanser had waited courteously He watched the door close He looked at the table and the chairs about it I will not tell you sir how sorry I am about this I wish it had not happened
	Mayor Orden bowed and Lanser went on I like you sir and I respect you but I have a job to do
	You surely recognize that
	Orden did not answer He looked straight into Lansers eyes
	We do not act alone or on our own judgment
	Between sentences Lanser waited for an answer but he received none
	There are rules laid down for us rules made in the capital This man has killed an officer
	At last Orden answered Why didnt you shoot him then That was the time to do it
	Lanser shook his head If I agreed with you it would make no difference You know as well as I that punishment is largely for the purpose of deterring the potential criminal Thus since punishment is for others than the punished it must be publicized It must even be dramatized He thrust a finger in back of his belt and flipped his little dagger
	Orden turned away and looked out of the window at the dark sky It will snow tonight he said
	Mayor Orden you know our orders are inexorable We must get the coal If your people are not orderly we will have to restore that order by force His voice grew stern We must shoot people if it is necessary If you wish to save your people from hurt you must help us to keep order Now it is considered wise by my government that punishment emanate from the local authority It makes for a more orderly situation
	Orden said softly So the people did know That is a mystery And louder he said You wish me to pass sentence of death on Alexander Morden after a trial here
	Yes and you will prevent much bloodshed later if you will do it
	Orden went to the table and pulled out the big chair at its head and sat down And suddenly he seemed to be the judge with Lanser the culprit He drummed with his fingers on the table He said You and your government do not understand Inall the world yours is the only government and people with a record of defeat after defeat for centuries and every time because you did not understand people He paused This principle does not work First I am the Mayor I have no right to pass sentence of death
	There is no one in this community with that right If I should do it I would be breaking the law as much as you
	Breaking the law said Lanser
	You killed six men when you came in Under our law you are guilty of murder all of you Why do you go into this nonsense of law Colonel There is no law between you and us This is war Dont you know you will have to kill all of us or we in time will kill all of you You destroyed the law when you came in and a new law took its place Dont you know that
	Lanser said May I sit down
	Why do you ask That is another lie You could make me stand if you wished
	Lanser said No it is true whether you believe it or not personally I have respect for you and your office andhe put his forehead in his hand for a momentyou see what I think sir I a man of a certain age and certain memories is of no importance I might agree with you but that would change nothing The military the political pattern I work in has certain tendencies and practices which are invariable
	Orden said And these tendencies and practices have been proven wrong in every single case since the beginning of the world
	Lanser laughed bitterly I an individual man with certain memories might agree with you might even add that one of the tendencies of the military mind and pattern is an inability to learn an inability to see beyond the killing which is its job But I am not a man subject to memories The coal miner must be shot publicly because the theory is that others will then restrain themselves from killing our men
	Orden said We need not talk any more then
	Yes we must talk We want you to help
	Orden sat quietly for a while and then he said Ill tell you what Ill do How many men were on the machine guns which killed our soldiers
	Oh not more than twenty I guess said Lanser
	Very well If you will shoot them I will condemn Morden
	Youre not serious said the colonel
	But I am serious
	This cant be done You know it
	I know it said Orden And what you ask cannot be done
	Lanser said I suppose I knew Corell will have to be Mayor after all He looked up quickly You will stay for the trial
	Yes Ill stay Then Alex wont be so lonely
	Lanser looked at him and smiled a little sadly We have taken on a job havent we
	Yes said the Mayor the one impossible job in the world the one thing that cant be done
	And that is
	To break mans spirit permanently
	Ordens head sank a little toward the table and he said without looking up Its started to snow It didnt wait for night I like the sweet cool smell of the snow



CHAPTER IV

By eleven oclock the snow was falling heavily in big soft puffs and the sky was not visible at all People were scurrying through the falling snow and snow piled up in the doorways and it piled up on the statue in the public square and on the rails from the mine to the harbor Snow piled up and the little cartwheels skidded as they were pushed along And over the town there hung a blackness that was deeper than the cloud and over the town there hunga sullenness and a dry growing hatred The people did not stand in the streets long but they entered the doors and the doors closed and there seemed to be eyes looking from behind the curtains and when the military went through the street or when the patrol walked down the main street the eyes were on the patrol cold and sullen And in the shops people came to buy little things for lunch and they asked for the goods and got it and paid for it and exchanged no goodday with the seller
	In the little palace drawingroom the lights were on and the lights shone on the falling snow outside the window The court was in session Lanser sat at the head of the table with Hunter on his right then Tonder and at the lower end Captain Loft with a little pile of papers in front of him On the opposite side Mayor Orden sat on the colonels left and Prackle was next to himPrackle who scribbled on his pad of paper Beside the table two guards stood with bayonets fixed with helmets on their heads and they were little wooden images Between them was Alex Morden a big young man with a wide low forehead with deepset eyes and a long sharp nose His chin was firm and his mouth sensual and wide
	He was wide of shoulder narrow of hip and in front of him his manacled hands clasped and unclasped
	He was dressed in black trousers a blue shirt open at the neck and a dark coat shiny from wear
	Captain Loft read from the paper in front of him When ordered back to work he refused to go and when the order was repeated the prisoner attacked Captain Loft with the pickax he carried Captain Bentick interposed his body 
	Mayor Orden coughed and when Loft stopped reading said Sit down Alex One of you guardsget him a chair The guard turned and pulled up a chair unquestioningly
	Loft said It is customary for the prisoner to stand
	Let him sit down Orden said Only we will know You can report that he stood
	It is not customary to falsify reports said Loft
	Sit down Alex Orden repeated
	And the big young man sat down and his manacled hands were restless in his lap
	Loft began This is contrary to all
	The colonel said lethim be seated
	Captain Loft cleared his throat Captain Bentick interposed his body and received a blow on the head which crushed his skull A medical report is appended Do you wish me to read it
	No need said Lanser Make it as quick as you can
	 Thesefacts have been witnessed by several of our soldiers whose statements are attached This military court finds that the prisoner is guilty of murder and recommends a death sentence Do you wish me to read the statements of the soldiers
	Lanser sighed No He turned to Alex You dont deny that you killed the captain do you
	Alex smiled sadly I hit him he said I dont know that I killed him
	Orden said Good work Alex And the two looked at each other as friends
	Loft said Do you mean to imply that he was killed by someone else
	I dont know said Alex I only hit him and then somebody hit me
	Colonel Lanser said Do you want to offer any explanation I cant think of anything that will change the sentence but we will listen
	Loft said I respectfully submit that the colonel should not have said that It indicates that the court is not impartial
	Orden laughed dryly The colonel looked at him and smiled a little Have you any explanation he repeated
	Alex lifted a hand to gesture and the other came with it He looked embarrassed and put them in his lap again I was mad he said I have a pretty bad temper He said I must work I am a free man I got mad and I hit him I guess I hit him hard It was the wrong man He pointed at Loft Thats the man I wanted to hit that one
	Lanser said It doesnt matter whom you wanted to hit Anybody would have been the same Are you sorry you did it He said aside to the table It would look well in the record if he were sorry
	Sorry Alex asked Im not sorry He told me to go to workme a free man I used to be alderman He said I had to work
	But if the sentence is death wont you be sorry then
	Alex sank his head and really tried to think honestly No  he said You mean would I do it again
	Thats what I mean
	No Alex said thoughtfully I dont think Im sorry
	Lanser said Put in the record that the prisoner was overcome with remorse Sentence is automatic Do you understand he said to Alex The court has no leeway The court finds you guilty and sentences you to be shot immediately I do not see any reason to torture you with this any more Captain Loft is there anything I have forgotten
	Youve forgotten me said Orden He stood up and pushed back his chair and stepped over to Alex
	And Alex from long habit stood up respectfully Alexander I am the elected Mayor
	I know it sir
	Alex these men are invaders They have taken our country by surprise and treachery and force
	Captain Loft said Sir this should not be permitted
	Lanser said Hush Is it better to hear it or would you rather it were whispered
	Orden went on as though he had not been interrupted When they came the people were confused and I was confused We did not know what to do or think Yours was the first clear act Your private anger was the beginning of a public anger I know it is said in town that I am acting with these men I can show the town but youyou are going to die I want you to know
	Alex dropped his head and then raised it I know sir 
	Lanser said Is the squad ready 
	Outside sir 
	Who is commanding 
	Lieutenant Tonder sir 
	Tonder raised his head and his chin was hard and he held his breath
	Orden said softly Are you afraid Alex 
	And Alex said Yes sir 
	I cant tell you not to be I would be too and so would these younggods of war 
	Lanser said Call your squad Tonder got up quickly and went to the door Theyre here sir He opened the door wide and the helmeted men could be seen
	Orden said Alex go knowing that these men will have no rest no rest at all until they are gone or dead You will make the people one Its a sad knowledge and little enough gift to you but it is so No rest at all
	Alex shut his eyes tightly Mayor Orden leaned close and kissed him on the cheek Goodbye Alex he said
	The guard took Alex by the arm and the young man kept his eyes tightly closed and they guided him through the door The squad faced about and their feet marched away down out of the house and into the snow and the snow muffled their footsteps
	The men about the table were silent Orden looked toward the window and saw a little round spot being rubbed clear of snow by a quick hand He stared at it fascinated and then he looked quickly away He said to the colonel I hope you know what you are doing
	Captain Loft gathered his papers and Lanser asked In the square Captain
	Yes in the square It must be public Loft said
	And Orden said I hope you know
	Man said the colonel whether we know or not it is what must be done
	Silence fell on the room and each man listened And it was not long From the distance there came a crash of firing Lanser sighed deeply Orden put his hand to his forehead and filled his lungs deeply Then there was a shout outside The glass of the window crashed inward and Lieutenant Prackle wheeled about He brought his hand up to his shoulder and stared at it
	Lanser leaped up crying So it starts Are you badly hurt Lieutenant
	My shoulder said Prackle
	Lanser took command Captain Loft there will be tracks in the snow Now I want every house searched for firearms I want every man who has one taken hostage You sir he said to the Mayor are placed in protective custody And understand this please we will shoot five ten a hundred for one
	Orden said quietly A man of certain memories
	Lanser stopped in the middle of an order He looked over slowly at the Mayor and for a moment they understood each other And then Lanser straightened his shoulders A man of no memories he said sharply And then I want every weapon in town gathered Bring in everyone who resists Hurry before their tracks are filled
	The staff found their helmets and loosed their pistols and started out And Orden went to the broken window He said sadly The sweet cool smell of the snow



CHAPTER V

The days and the weeks dragged on and the months dragged on The snow fell and melted and fell and melted and finally fell and stuck The dark buildings of the little town wore bells and hats and eyebrows of white and there were trenches through the snow to the doorways In the harbor the coal barges came empty and went away loaded but the coal did not come out of the ground easily The good miners made mistakes They were clumsy and slow Machinery broke and took a long time to fix The people of the conquered country settled in a slow silent waiting revenge The men who had been traitors who had helped the invadersand many of them believed it was for a better state and an ideal way of lifefound that the control they took was insecure that the people they had known looked at them coldly and never spoke
	And there was death in the air hovering and waiting Accidents happened on the railroad which clung to the mountains and connected the little town with the rest of the nation Avalanches poured down on the tracks and rails were spread No train could move unless the tracks were first inspected People were shot in reprisal and it made no difference Now and then a group of young men escaped and went to England And the English bombed the coal mine and did some damage and killed some of both their friends and their enemies And it did no good The cold hatred grew with the winter the silent sullen hatred the waiting hatred The fool supply was controlledissued to the obedient and withheld from the disobedientso that the whole population turned coldly obedient There was a point where food could not be withheld for a starving man cannot mine coal cannot lift and carry And the hatred was deep in the eyes of the people beneath the surface
	Now it was that the conqueror was surrounded the men of the battalion alone among silent enemies and no man might relax his guard for even a moment If he did he disappeared and some snowdrift received his body If he went alone to a woman he disappeared and some snowdrift received his body
	If he drank he disappeared The men of the battalion could sing only together could dance only together and dancing graduallystopped and the singing expressed a longing for home Their talk was of friends and relatives who loved them and their longings were for warmth and love because a man can be a soldier for only so many hours a day and for only so many months in a year and then he wants to be a man again wants girls and drinks and music and laughter and ease and when these are cut off they become irresistibly desirable
	And the men thought always of home The men of the battalion came to detest the place they had conquered and they were curt with the people and the people were curt with them and gradually a little fear began to grow in the conquerors a fear that it would never be over that they could never relax or go home a fear that one day they would crack and be hunted through the mountains like rabbits for the conquered never relaxed their hatred The patrols seeing lights hearing laughter would be drawn as to a fire and when they came near the laughter stopped the warmth went out and the people were cold and obedient And the soldiers smelling warm food from the little restaurants went in and ordered the warm food and found that it was oversalted or overpeppered
	Then the soldiers read the news from home and from the other conquered countries and the news was always good and for a little while they believed it and then after a while they did not believe it any more
	And every man carried in his heart the terror If home crumbled they would not tell us and then it would be too late These people will not spare us They will kill us all They remembered stories of their men retreating through Belgium and retreating out of Russia And the more literate remembered the frantic tragic retreat from Moscow when every peasants pitchfork tasted blood and the snow was rotten with bodies
	And they knew when they cracked or relaxed or slept too long it would be the same here and their sleep was restless and their days were nervous They asked questions their officers could not answer because they did not know They were not told either They did not believe the reports from home either
	Thus it came about that the conquerors grew afraid of the conquered and their nerves wore thin and they shot at shadows in the night The cold sullen silence was with them always Then three soldiers went insane in a week and cried all night and all day until they were sent away home And others might have gone insane if they had not heard that mercy deaths awaited the insane at home and a mercy death is a terrible thing to think of Fear crept in on the men in their billets and it made them sad and it crept into the patrols and it made them cruel
	The year turned and the nights grew long It was dark at three oclock in the afternoon and not light again until nine in the morning The jolly lights did not shine out on the snow for by law every window must be black against the bombers And yet when the English bombers came over some light always appeared near the coal mine Sometimes the sentries shot a man with a lantern and once a girl with a flashlight And it did no good Nothing was cured by the shooting
	And the officers were a reflection of their men more restrained because their training was more complete more resourceful because they had more responsibility but the same fears were a little deeper buried in them the same longings were more tightly locked in their hearts And they were under a double strain for the conquered people watched them for mistakes and their own men watched them for weakness so that their spirits were taut to the breakingpoint The conquerors were under a terrible spiritual siege and everyone knew conquered and conquerors what would happen when the first crack appeared
	From the upstairs room of the Mayors palace the comfort seemed to have gone Over the windows black paper was tacked tightly and there were little piles of precious equipment about the roomthe instruments and equipment that could not be jeopardized the glasses and masks and helmets And discipline here at least was laxer as though these officers knew there must be some laxness somewhere or the machine would break On the table were two gasoline lanterns which threw a hard brilliant light and they made great shadows on the walls and their hissing was an undercurrent in the room
	Major Hunter went on with his work His drawingboard was permanently ready now for the bombs tore out his work nearly as fast as he put it in And he had little sorrow for to Major Hunter building was life and here he had more building than he could project or accomplish He sat at his drawingboard with a light behind him and his Tsquare moved up and down the board and his pencil was busy
	Lieutenant Prackle his arm still in a sling sat in a straight chair behind the center table reading an illustrated paper At the end of the table Lieutenant Tonder was writing a letter He held his pen pinched high and occasionally he looked up from his letter and gazed at the ceiling to find words to put in his letter
	Prackle turned a page of the illustrated paper and he said I can close my eyes and see every shop on this street here And Hunter went on with his work and Tonder wrote a few more words Prackle continued There is a restaurant right behind here You cant see it in the picture Its called Burdens
	Hunter did not look up He said I know the place They had good scallops
	Sure they did Prackle said Everything was good there Not a single bad thing did they serve And their coffee
	Tonder looked up from his letter and said They wont be serving coffee nowor scallops
	Well I dont know about that said Prackle They did and they will again And there was a waitress there He described her figure with his hand with the good handBlonde so and so He looked down at the magazine She had the strangest eyeshas I meanalways kind of moistlooking as though she had just been laughing or crying He glanced at the ceiling and he spoke softly I was out with her She was lovely I wonder why I didnt go back oftener I wonder if shes still there
	Tonder said gloomily Probably not Working in a factory maybe
	Prackle laughed I hope they arent rationing girls at home
	Why not said Tonder
	Prackle said playfully You dont care much for girls do you Not much you dont
	Tonder said I like them for what girls are for I dont let them crawl around my other life
	And Prackle said tauntingly It seems to me that they crawl all over you all the time
	Tonder tried to change the subject He said I hate these damn lanterns Major when are you going to get that dynamo fixed
	Major Hunter looked up slowly from his board and said It should be done by now Ive got good men working on it Ill double the guard on it from now on I guess
	Did you get the fellow that wrecked it Prackle asked
	And Hunter said grimly It might be any one of five men I got all five He went on musingly Its so easy to wreck a dynamo if you know how Just short it and it wrecks itself He said The light ought to be on any time now
	Prackle still looked at his magazine I wonder when we will be relieved I wonder when we will go home for a while Major wouldnt you like to go home for a rest
	Hunter looked up from his work and his face was hopeless for a moment Yes of course He recovered himself Ive built this siding four times I dont know why a bomb always knocks out this particular siding Im getting tired of this piece of track I have to change the route every time because of the craters Theres no time to fill them in The ground is frozen too hard It seems to be too much work
	Suddenly the electric lights came on and Tonder automatically reached out and turned off the two gasoline lanterns The hissing was gone from the room
	Tonder said Thank God for that That hissing gets on my nerves It makes me think theres whispering He folded the letter he had been writing and he said Its strange more letters dont come through Ive only had one in two weeks
	Prackle said Maybe nobody writes to you
	Maybe said Tonder He turned to the major If anything happenedat home I meando you think they would let us knowanything bad I mean any deaths or anything like that
	Hunter said I dont know
	Well Tonder went on I would like to get out of this godforsaken hole
	Prackle broke in I thought you were going to live here after the war And he imitated Tonders voice
	Put four or five farms together Make a nice place a kind of family seat Wasnt that it Going to be a little lord of the valley werent you Nice pleasant people beautiful lawns and deer and little children
	Isnt that the way it was Tonder
	As Prackle spoke Tonders hand dropped Then he clasped his temples with his hands and he spoke with emotion Be still Dont talk like that These people These horrible people These cold people
	They never look at you He shivered They never speak They answer like dead men Theyobey these horrible people And the girls are frozen
	There was a light tap on the door and Joseph came in with a scuttle of coal He moved silently through the room and set the scuttle down so softly that he made no noise and he turned without looking up at anyone and went toward the door again Prackle said loudly Joseph And Joseph turned without replying without looking up and he bowed very slightly And Prackle said still loudly Joseph is there any wine or any brandy Joseph shook his head
	Tonder started up from the table his face wild with anger and he shouted Answer you swine Answer in words
	Joseph did not look up He spoke tonelessly No sir no sir there is no wine
	And Tonder said furiously And no brandy
	Joseph looked down and spoke tonelessly again thereis no brandy sir He stood perfectly still
	What do you want Tonder said I want to go sir
	Then go goddamn it
	Joseph turned and went silently out of the room and Tonder took a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his face Hunter looked up at him and said You shouldnt let him beat you so easily
	Tonder sat down in his chair and put his hands to his temples and he said brokenly I want a girl I want to go home I want a girl Theres a girl in this town a pretty girl I see her all the time She has blond hair She lives beside the oldiron store I want that girl
	Prackle said Watchyourself Watch your nerves
	At that moment the lights went out again and the room was in darkness Hunter spoke while the matches were being struck and an attempt was being made to light the lanterns he said I thought I had all of them I must have missed one But I cant be running down there all the time Ive got good men down there
	Tonder lighted the first lantern and then he lighted the other and Hunter spoke sternly to Tonder
	Lieutenant do your talking to us if you have to talk Dont let the enemy hear you talk this way Theres nothing these people would like better than to know your nerves are getting thin Dont let the enemy hear you
	Tonder sat down again The light was sharp on his face and the hissing filled the room He said Thats it The enemys everywhere Every man every woman even children The enemys everywhere Their faces look out of doorways The white faces behind the curtains listening We have beaten them we have won everywhere and they wait and obey and they wait Half the world is ours Is it the same in other places Major
	And Hunter said I dont know
	Thats it Tonder said We dont know The reportseverything in hand Conquered countries cheer our soldiers cheer the new order His voice changed and grew soft and still softer What do the reports say about us Do they say we are cheered loved flowers in our paths Oh these horrible people waiting in the snow
	And Hunter said Now thats off your chest do you feel better
	Prackle had been beating the table softly with his good fist and he said He shouldnt talk that way He should keep things to himself Hes a soldier isnt he Then let him be a soldier
	The door opened quietly and Captain Loft came in and there was snow on his helmet and snow on his shoulders His nose was pinched and red and his overcoat collar was high about his ears He took off his helmet and the snow fell to the floor and he brushed his shoulders What a job he said More trouble Hunter asked
	Always trouble I see theyve got your dynamo again Well I think I fixed the mine for a while
	Whats your trouble Hunter asked
	Oh the usual thing with methe slowdown and a wrecked dump car I saw the wrecker though I shot him I think I have a cure for it Major now I just thought it up Ill make each man take out a certain amount of coal I cant starve the men or they cant work but Ive really got the answer If the coal doesnt come out no food for the families Well have the men eat at the mine so theres no dividing at home That ought to cure it They work or their kids dont eat I told them just now
	What did they say
	Lofts eyes narrowed fiercely Say What do they ever say Nothing Nothing at all But well see whether the coal comes out now He took off his coat and shook it and his eyes fell on the entrance door and he saw that it was open a crack He moved silently to the door jerked it open then closed it I thought I had closed that door tight he said You did said Hunter
	Prackle still turned the pages of his illustrated paper His voice was normal again Those are monster guns were using in the east I never saw one of them Did you Captain
	Oh yes said Captain Loft Ive seen them fired Theyre wonderful Nothing can stand up against them
	Tonder said Captain do you get much news from home
	A certain amount said Loft
	Is everything well there
	Wonderful said Loft
	The armies move ahead everywhere
	The British arent defeated yet
	They are defeated in every engagement
	But they fight on 
	A few air raids no more 
	And the Russians 
	Its all over 
	Tonder said insistently But they fight on 
	A little skirmishing no more 
	Then we have just about won havent we Captain Tonder asked Yes we have 
	Tonder looked closely at him and said you believe this dont you Captain 
	Prackle broke in Dont let him start that again 
	Loft scowled at Tonder I dont know what you mean 
	Tonder said I mean this well be going home before long wont we 
	Well the reorganization will take some time Hunter said The new order cant be put into effect in a day can it 
	Tonder said All our lives perhaps 
	And Prackle said Dont let him start it again 
	Loft came very close to Tonder and he said Lieutenant I dont like the tone of your questions I dont like the tone of doubt 
	Hunter looked up and said Dont be hard on him Loft Hes tired Were all tired 
	Well Im tired too said Loft but I dont let treasonable doubts get in 
	Hunter said Dont bedevil him I tell you Wheres the colonel do you know 
	Hes making out his report Hes asking for reinforcements said Loft Its a bigger job than we thought 
	Prackle asked excitedly Will he get themthe reinforcements 
	How would I know 
	Tonder smiled Reinforcements he said softlyOr maybe replacements Maybe we could go home for a while And he said smiling Maybe I could walk down the street and people would say Helloand theyd say There goes a soldier and theyd be glad for me and theyd be glad of me And thered be friends about and I could turn my back to a man without being afraid
	Prackle said Dont start that again Dont let him get out of hand again 
	And Loft said disgustedly We have enough trouble now without having the staff go crazy 
	But Tonder went on You really think replacements will come Captain 
	I didnt say so 
	But you said they might 
	I said I didnt know Look Lieutenant weve conquered half the world We must police it for a while
	You know that 
	But the other halfTonder asked
	They will fight on hopelessly for a while said Loft
	Then we must be spread out all over 
	For a while said Loft
	Prackle said nervously I wish youd make him shut up I wish you would shut him up Make him stop it
	Tonder got out his handkerchief and blew his nose and he spoke a little like a man out of his head He laughed embarrassedly He said I had a funny dream I guess it was a dream Maybe it was a thought
	Maybe a thought or a dream
	Prackle said Make him stop Captain
	Tonder said Captain is this place conquered
	Of course said Loft
	A little note of hysteria crept into Tonders laughter He said Conquered and were afraid conquered and were surrounded His laughter grew shrill I had a dreamor a thoughtout in the snow with the black shadows and the faces in the doorways the cold faces behind curtains I had a thought or a dream
	Prackle said Make him stop 
	Tonder said I dreamed the Leader was crazy 
	And Loft and Hunter laughed together and Loft said Theenemy have found out how crazy Ill have to write that one home The papers would print that one The enemy have learned how crazy the Leader is
	And Tonder went on laughingConquest after conquest deeper and deeper into molasses His laughter choked him and he coughed into his handkerchief Maybe the Leader is crazy Flies conquer the flypaper Flies capture two hundred miles of new flypaper His laughter was growing more hysterical now
	Prackle leaned over and shook him with his good hand Stop it You stop it You have no right
	And gradually Loft recognized that the laughter was hysterical and he stepped close to Tonder and slapped him in the face He said Lieutenant stop it
	Tonders laughter went on and Loft slapped him again in the face and he said Stop it Lieutenant Do you hear me
	Suddenly Tonders laughter stopped and the room was quiet except for the hissing of the lanterns
	Tonder looked in amazement at his hand and he felt his bruised face with his hand and he looked at his hand again and his head sank down toward the table I want to go home he said



CHAPTER VI

There was a little street not far from the town square where small peaked roofs and little shops were mixed up together The snow was beaten down on the walks and in the street but it piled high on the fences and it puffed on the roof peaks It drifted against the shuttered windows of the little houses And into the yards paths were shoveled The night was dark and cold and no light showed from the windows to attract the bombers And no one walked in the streets for the curfew was strict The houses were dark lumps against the snow Every little while the patrol of six men walked down the street peering about and each man carried a long flashlight The hushed tramp of their feet sounded in the street the squeaks of their boots on the packed snow They were mined figures deep in thick coats under their helmets were knitted caps which came down over their ears and covered their chins and mouths A little snow fell only a little like rice
	The patrol talked as they walked and they talked of things that they longed forof meat and of hot soup and of the richness of butter of the prettiness of girls and of their smiles and of their lips and their eyes They talked of these things and sometimes they talked of their hatred of what they were doing and of their loneliness
	A small peakroofed house beside the iron shop was shaped like the others and wore its snow cap like the others No light came from its shuttered windows and its storm doors were tightly closed But inside a lamp burned in the small livingroom and the door to the bedroom was open and the door to the kitchen was open An iron stove was against the back wall with a little coal fire burning in it It was a warm poor comfortable room the floor covered with worn carpet the walls papered in warm brown with an oldfashioned fleurdelis figure in gold And on the back wall were two pictures one of fish lying dead on a plate of ferns and the other of grouse lying dead on a fir bough On the right wall there was a picture of Christ walking on the waves toward the despairing fishermen Two straight chairs were in the room and a couch covered with a bright blanket There was a little round table in the middle of the room on which stood a kerosene lamp with a round flowered shade on it and the light in the room was warm and soft
	The inner door which led to the passage which in turn led to the storm door was beside the stove
	In a cushioned old rockingchair beside the table Molly Morden sat alone She was unraveling the wool from an old blue sweater and winding the yarn on a ball She had quite a large ball of it And on the table beside her was her knitting with the needles sticking in it and a large pair of scissors Her glasses lay on the table beside her for she did not need them for knitting She was pretty and young and neat Her golden hair was done up on the top of her head and a blue bow was in her hair Her hands worked quickly with the raveling As she worked she glanced now and then at the door to the passage The wind whistled in the chimney softly but it was a quiet night muffled with snow
	Suddenly she stopped her work Her hands were still She looked toward the door and listened The tramping feet of the patrol went by in the street and the sound of their voices could be heard faintly The sound faded away Molly ripped out new yarn and wound it on the ball And again she stopped There was a rustle at the door and then three short knocks Molly put down her work and went to the door
	Yes she called
	She unlocked the door and opened it and a heavily cloaked figure came in It was Annie the cook redeyed and wrapped in mufflers She slipped in quickly as though practiced at getting speedily through doors and getting them closed again behind her She stood there rednosed sniffling and glancing quickly around the room
	Molly said Good evening Annie I didnt expect you tonight Take your things off and get warm Its cold out
	Annie said The soldiers brought winter early My father always said a war brought bad weather or bad weather brought a war I dont remember which
	Take off your things and come to the stove
	I cant said Annie importantly Theyre coming
	Who are coming Molly said
	His Excellency said Annie and the doctor and the two Anders boys
	Here Molly askedWhat for
	Annie held out her hand and there was a little package in it Take it she said I stole it from the colonels plate Its meat
	And Mollyunwrapped the little cake of meat and put it in her mouth and she spoke around her chewing
	Did you get some
	Annie said I cook it dont I I always get some
	When are they coming
	Annie sniffled The Anders boys are sailing for England Theyve got to Theyre hiding now
	Are they Molly askedWhat for
	Well it was their brother Jack was shot today for wrecking that little car The soldiers are looking for the rest of the family You know how they do
	Yes Molly said I know how they do Sit down Annie
	No time said Annie Ive got to get back and tell His Excellency its all right here 
	Molly said Did anybody see you come 
	Annie smiled proudly No Im awful good at sneaking 
	How will the Mayor get out 
	Annie laughed Joseph is going to be in his bed in case they look in right in his nightshirt right next to Madame And she laughed again She said Joseph better lie pretty quiet 
	Molly said Its an awful night to be sailing 
	Its better than being shot 
	Yes so it is Why is the Mayor coming here 
	I dont know He wants to talk to the Anders boys Ive got to go now but I came to tell you 
	Molly said How soon are they coming 
	Oh maybe half maybe threequarters of an hour Annie said Ill come in first Nobody bothers with old cooks She started for the door and she turned midway and as though accusing Molly of saying the last words she said truculently Im not so old And she slipped out of the door and closed it behind her
	Molly went on knitting for a moment and then she got up and went to the stove and lifted the lid The glow of the fire lighted her face She stirred the fire and added a few lumps of coal and closed the stove again Before she could get to her chair there was a knocking on the outer door She crossed the room and said to herself I wonder what she forgot She went into the passage and she said What do you want
	A mans voice answered her She opened the door and a mans voice said I dont mean any harm I dont mean any harm
	Molly backed into the room and Lieutenant Tonder followed her in Molly said Who are you What do you want You cant come in here What do you want
	Lieutenant Tonder was dressed in his great gray overcoat He entered the room and took off his helmet and he spoke pleadingly I dont mean any harm Please let me come in
	Molly said What do you want 
	She shut the door behind him and he said Miss I only want to talk thats all I want to hear you talk
	Thats all I want 
	Are you forcing yourself on me Molly asked
	No miss just let me stay a little while and then Ill go 
	What is it you want 
	Tonder tried to explain Can you understand thiscan you believe this Just for a little while cant we forget this war Just for a little while Just for a little while cant we talk together like peopletogether
	Molly looked at him for a long time and then a smile came to her lips You dont know who I am do you
	Tonder said Ive seen you in the town I know youre lovely I know I want to talk to you
	And Molly still smiled She said softly You dont know who I am She sat in her chair and Tonder stood like a child looking very clumsy Molly continued speaking quietly Why youre lonely Its as simple as that isnt it
	Tonder licked his lips and he spoke eagerly Thats it he said You understand I knew you would I knew youd have to His words came tumbling out Im lonely to the point of illness Im lonely in the quiet and the hatred And he said pleadingly Cant we talk just a little bit
	Molly picked up her knitting She looked quickly at the front door You can stay not more than fifteen minutes Sit down a little Lieutenant
	She looked at the door again The house creaked Tonder became tense and he said Is someone here
	No the snow is heavy on the roof I have no man any more to push down
	Tonder said gently Who did it Was it something we did
	And Molly nodded looking far off Yes
	He sat down Im sorry After a moment he said I wish I could do something Ill have the snow pushed off the roof
	No said Molly no
	Why not
	Because the people would think I had joined with you They would expel me I dont want to be expelled
	Tonder said Yes I see how that would be You all hate us But Ill take care of you if youll let me
	Now Molly knew she was in control and her eyes narrowed a little cruelly and she said Why do you ask You are the conqueror Your men dont have to ask They take what they want
	Thats not what I want Tonder said Thats not the way I want it
	And Molly laughed still a little cruelly You want me to like you dont you Lieutenant
	He said simply Yes and he raised his head and he said You are so beautiful so warm Your hair is bright Oh Ive seen no kindness in a womans face for so long
	Do you see any in mine she asked
	He looked closely at her I want to 
	She dropped her eyes at last Youre making love to me arent you Lieutenant 
	And he said clumsily I want you to like me Surely I want you to like me Surely I want to see that in your eyes I have seen you in the streets I have watched you pass by Ive given orders that you mustnt be molested Have you been molested 
	And Molly said quietly Thank you no Ive not been molested 
	His words rushed on Why Ive even written a poem for you Would you like to see my poem 
	And she said sardonically Is it a long poem You have to go very soon 
	He said No its a little tiny poem Its a little bit of a poem He reached inside his tunic and brought out a folded paper and handed it to her She leaned close to the lamp and put on her glasses and she read quietly

	Your eyes in their deep heavens
	Possess me and will not depart
	A sea of blue thoughts rushing
	And pouring over my heart
	
	She folded the paper and put it in her lap Did you write this Lieutenant 
	Yes 
	She said a little tauntingly To me 
	And Tonder answered uneasily Yes 
	She looked at him steadily smiling You didnt write it Lieutenant did you 
	He smiled back like a child caught in a lie No 
	Molly asked him Do you know who did 
	Tonder said Yes Heine wrote it Its Mit deinen blauen Augem Ive always loved it He laughed embarrassedly and Molly laughed with him and suddenly they were laughing together He stopped laughing just as suddenly anda bleakness came into his eyes I havent laughed like that since forever
	He said They told us the people would like us would admire us They do not They only hate us And then he changed the subject as though he worked against time You are so beautiful You are beautiful as the laughter
	Molly said Youre beginning to make love to me Lieutenant You must go in a moment
	And Tonder said Maybe I want to make love to you A man needs love A man dies without love His insides shrivel and his chest feels like a dry chip Im lonely
	Molly got up from her chair She looked nervously at the door and she walked to the stove and coming back her face grew hard and her eyes grew punishing and she said Do you want to go to bed with me Lieutenant
	I didnt say that Why do you talk that way
	Molly said cruelly Maybe Im trying to disgust you I was married once My husband is dead You see Im not a virgin Her voice was bitter
	Tonder said I only want you to like me
	And Molly said I know You are a civilized man You know that lovemaking is more full and whole and delightful if thereis liking too
	Tonder said Dont talk that way Please dont talk that way
	Molly glanced quickly at the door She said We are a conquered people Lieutenant You have taken the food away Im hungry Ill like you better if you feed me
	Tonder said What are you saying
	Do I disgust you Lieutenant Maybe Im trying to My price is two sausages
	Tonder said You cant talk this way
	What about your own girls Lieutenant after the last war A man could choose among your girls for an egg or a slice of bread Do you want me for nothing Lieutenant Is the price too high
	He said You fooled me for a moment But you hate me too dont you I thought maybe you wouldnt
	No I dont hate you she said Im hungry andI hate you
	Tonder said Ill give you anything you need but
	And she interrupted him You want to call it something else You dont want a whore Is that what you mean
	Tonder said I dont know what I mean You make it sound full of hatred
	Molly laughed She said Its not nice to be hungry Two sausages two fine fat sausages can be the most precious things in the world
	Dont say those things he said Please dont
	Why not Theyre true 
	They arent true This cant be true 
	She looked at him for a moment and then she sat down and her eyes fell to her lap and she said No its not true I dont hate you Im lonely too And the snow is heavy on the roof 
	Tonder got up and moved near to her He took one of her hands in both of his and he said softly Please dont hate me Im only a lieutenant I didnt ask to come here You didnt ask to be my enemy
	Im only a man not a conquering man
	Mollys fingers encircled his hand for a moment and she said softly I know yes I know
	And Tonder said We have some little right to life in all this death
	She put her hand to his cheek for a moment and she said Yes
	Ill take care of you he said We have some right to life in all the killing His hand rested on her shoulder Suddenly she grew rigid and her eyes were wide and staring as though she saw a vision His hand released her and he asked Whats the matter What is it Her eyes stared straight ahead and he repeated What is it 
	Molly spoke in a haunted voice I dressed him like a little boy for his first day in school And he was afraid I buttoned his shirt and tried to comfort him but he was beyond comfort And he was afraid 
	Tonder said What are you saying 
	And Molly seemed to see what she described I dont know why they let him come home He was confused He didnt know what was happening He didnt even kiss me when he went away He was afraid and very brave like a little boy on his first day of school 
	Tonder stood up That was your husband 
	Molly said Yes my husband I went to the Mayor but he was helpless And then he marched awaynot very well nor steadilyand you took him out and you shot him It was more strange than terrible then I didnt quite believe it then
	Tonder said Your husband
	Yes and now in the quiet house I believe it Now with the heavy snow on the roof I believe it And in the loneliness before daybreak in the halfwarmed bed I know it then
	Tonder stood in front of her His face was full of misery Good night he said God keep you May I come back
	And Molly looked at the wall and at the memory I dont know she said
	Ill come back
	I dont know
	He looked at her and then he quietly went out of the door and Molly still stared at the wall God keep me She stayed for a moment staring at the wall The door opened silently and Annie came in Molly did not even see her
	Annie said disapprovingly The door was open 
	Molly looked slowly toward her her eyes still wide open Yes Oh yes Annie 
	The door was open There was a man came out I saw him He looked like a soldier 
	And Molly said Yes Annie 
	Was it a soldier here 
	Yes it was a soldier 
	And Annie asked suspiciously What was he doing here 
	He came to make love to me 
	Annie said Miss what are you doing You havent joined them have you You arent with them like that Corell 
	No Im not with them Annie 
	Annie said If the Mayors here and they come back itll be your fault if anything happens itll be your fault 
	He wont come back I wont let him come back 
	But the suspicion stayed with Annie She said Shall I tell them to come in now Do you say its safe 
	Yes its safe Where are they 
	Theyre out behind the fence said Annie
	Tell them to come in 
	And while Annie went out Molly got up and smoothed her hair and she shook her head trying to be alive again There was a little sound in the passage Two tall blond young men entered They were dressed in peajackets and dark turtleneck sweaters They wore stocking caps perched on their heads
	They were windburned and strong and they looked almost like twins Will Anders and Tom Anders the fishermen
	Good evening Molly Youve heard 
	Annie told me Its a bad night to go 
	Tom said Its better than a clear night The planes see you on a clear night Whats the Mayor want Molly 
	I dont know I heard about your brother Im sorry 
	The two were silent and they looked embarrassed Tom said You know how it is better than most 
	Yes yes I know 
	Annie came in the door again and she said in a hoarse whisper Theyre here And Mayor Orden and Doctor Winter came in They took off their coats and caps and laid them on the couch Orden went to Molly and kissed her on the forehead
	Good evening dear 
	He turned to Annie Stand in the passage Annie Give us one knock for the patrol one when its gone and two for danger You can leave the outer door open a crack so you can hear if anyone comes 
	Annie said Yes sir She went into the passage and shut the door behind her
	Doctor Winter was at the stove warming his hands We got word you boys were going tonight 
	Weve got to go Tom said
	Orden nodded Yes I know We heard you were going to take Mr Corell with you 
	Tom laughed bitterly We thought it would be only right Were taking his boat We cant leave him around It isnt good to see him in the streets 
	Orden said sadly I wish he had gone away Its just a danger to you taking him 
	It isnt good to see him in the streets Will echoed his brother It isnt good for the people to see him here 
	Winter asked Can you take him Isnt he cautious at all 
	Oh yes hes cautious in a way At twelve oclock though he walks to his house usually Well be behind the wall I think we can get him through his lower garden to the water His boats tied up there
	We were on her today getting her ready
	Orden repeated I wish you didnt have to Its just an added danger If he makes a noise the patrol might come
	Tom said He wont make a noise and its better if he disappears at sea Some of the town people might get him and then there would be too much killing No its better if he goes to sea
	Molly took up her knitting again She said Will you throw him overboard
	Will blushed Hell go to sea maam He turned to the Mayor You wanted to see us sir
	Why yes I want to talk to you Doctor Winter and I have tried to thinktheres so much talk about justice injustice conquest Our people are invaded but I dont think theyre conquered
	There was a sharp knock on the door and the room was silent Mollys needles stopped and the Mayors outstretched hand remained in the air Tom scratching his ear left his hand there and stopped scratching Everyone in the room was motionless Every eye was turned toward the door Then first faintly and then growing louder there came the tramp of the patrol the squeak of their boots in the snow and the sound of their talking as they went by They passed the door and their footsteps disappeared in the distance There was a second tap on the door And in the room the people relaxed
	Orden said It must be cold out there for Annie He took up his coat from the couch and opened the inner door and handed his coat through Put this around your shoulders Annie he said and closed the door
	I dont know what Id do without her he saidShe gets everywhere she sees and hears everything
	Tom said We should be going pretty soon sir
	And Winter said I wish youd forget about Mr Corell
	We cant It isnt good to see him in the streets He looked inquiringly at Mayor Orden
	Orden began slowly I want to speak simply This is a little town Justice and injustice are in terms of little things Your brothers shot and Alex Mordens shot Revenge against a traitor The people are angry and they have no way to fight back But its all in little terms Its people against people not idea against idea
	Winter said Its funny for a doctor to think of destruction but I think all invaded people want to resist
	We are disarmed our spirits and bodies arent enough The spirit of a disarmed man sinks
	Will Anders asked Whats all this for sir What do you want of us
	We want to fight them and we cant Orden said Theyre using hunger on the people now Hunger brings weakness You boys are sailing for England Maybe nobody will listen to you but tell them from usfrom a small townto give us weapons
	Tom asked You want guns
	Again there was a quick knock on the door and the people froze where they were and from outside there came the sound of the patrol but at double step running Willmoved quickly toward the door The running steps came abreast of the house There were muffled orders and the patrol ran by and there was a second tap at the door
	Molly said They must be after somebody I wonder who this time
	We should be going Tom said uneasily Do you want guns sir Shall we ask for guns
	No tell them how it is We are watched Any move we make calls for reprisal If we could have simple secret weapons weapons of stealth explosives dynamite to blow up rails grenades if possible even poison He spoke angrily This is no honorable war This is a war of treachery and murder Let us use the methods that have been used on us Let the British bombers drop their big bombs on the works but let them also drop us little bombs to use to hide to slip under the rails water tanks Then we will be armed secretly armed Then the invaders will never know which of us is armed Let the bombers bring us simple weapons We will know how to use them
	Winter broke in Theyll never know where it will strike The soldiers the patrol will never know which of us is armed
	Tom wiped his forehead If we get through well tell them sir butwell Ive heard it said that in England there are still men in power who do not dare to put weapons in the hands of common people
	Orden stared at him Oh I hadnt thought of that Well we can only see If such people still govern England and America the world is lost anyway Tell them what we say if they will listen We must have help but if we get ithis face grew every hardif we get it we will help ourselves
	Winter said If they will even give us dynamite to hide to bury in the ground to be ready against need then the invader can never rest again never We will blow up his supplies
	The room grew excited Molly said fiercely Yes we could fight his rest then We could fight his sleep
	We could fight his nerves and his certainties
	Will asked quietly Is that all sir 
	Yes Orden nodded Thats the core of it 
	What if they wont listen 
	You can only try as you are trying the sea tonight 
	Is that all sir 
	The door opened and Annie came quietly in Orden went on Thats all If you have to go now let me send Annie out to see that the way is clear He looked up and saw that Annie had come in Annie said Theres a soldier coming up the path He looks like the soldier that was here before There was a soldier here with Molly before
	The others looked at Molly Annie said I locked the door 
	What does he want Molly asked Why does he come back 
	There was a gentle knocking at the outside door Orden went to Molly What is this Molly Are you in trouble 
	No she said no Go out the back way You can get out through the back Hurry hurry out 
	The knocking continued on the front door A mans voice called softly Molly opened the door to the kitchen She said Hurry hurry 
	The Mayor stood in front of her Are you in trouble Molly You havent done anything 
	Annie said coldly It looks like the same soldier There was a soldier here before 
	Yes Molly said to the Mayor Yes there was a soldier here before 
	The Mayor said What did he want 
	He wanted to make love to me
	But he didnt Orden said
	No she said he didnt Go now and Ill take care
	Orden said Molly if youre in trouble let us help you
	The trouble Im in no one can help me with she said Gonow and she pushed them out of the door
	Annie remained behind She looked at Molly Miss what does this soldier want
	I dont know what he wants
	Are you going to tell him anything
	No Wonderingly Molly repeated No And then sharply she said No Annie Im not
	Annie scowled at her Miss youd better not tell him anything And she went out and closed the door behind her
	The tapping continued on the front door and a mans voice could be heard through the door
	Molly went to the center lamp and her burden was heavy on her She looked down at the lamp She looked at the table and she saw the big scissors lyingbeside her knitting She picked them up wonderingly by the blades The blades slipped through her fingers until she held the long shears and she was holding them like a knife and her eyes were horrified She looked down into the lamp and the light flooded up in her face Slowly she raised the shears and placed them inside her dress
	The tapping continued on the door She heard the voice calling to her She leaned over the lamp for a moment and then suddenly she blew out the light The room was dark except for a spot of red that came from the coal stove She opened the door Her voice was strained and sweet She called Im coming Lieutenant Im coming



CHAPTER VII

In the dark clear night a white halfwithered moon brought little light The wind was dry and singing over the snow a quiet wind that blew steadily evenly from the cold point of the Pole Over the land the snow lay very deep and dry as sand The houses snuggled down in the hollows of banked snow and their windows were dark and shuttered against the cold and only a little smoke rose from the banked fires
	In the town the footpaths were frozen hard and packed hard And the streets were silent too except when the miserable cold patrol came by The houses were dark against the night and a little lingering warmth remained in the houses against the morning Near the mine entrance the guards watched the sky and trained their instruments on the sky and turned their listeninginstruments against the sky for it was a clear night for bombing On nightsthis the feathered steel spindles came whistling down and roared to splinters The land would be visible from the sky tonight even though the moon seemed to throw little light
	Down toward one end of the village among the small houses a dog complained about the cold and the loneliness He raised his nose to his god and gave a long and fulsome account of the state of the world as it applied to him He was a practiced singer with a full bell throat and great versatility of range and control The six men of the patrol slogging dejectedly up and down the streets heard the singing of the dog and one of the muffled soldiers said Seems to me hes getting worse every night I suppose we ought to shoot him
	And another answered Why Let him howl He sounds good to me I used to have a dog at home that howled I never could break him Yellow dog I dont mind the howl They took my dog when they took the others he said factually in a dull voice
	And the corporal said Couldnt have dogs eating up food that was needed
	Oh Im not complaining I know it was necessary I cant plan the way the leaders do It seems funny to me though that some people here have dogs and they dont have even as much food as we have
	Theyre pretty gaunt though dogs and people
	Theyre fools said the corporal Thats why they lost so quickly Theycant plan the way we can
	I wonder if well have dogs again after its over said the soldier I suppose we could get them from America or some place and start the breeds again What kind of dogs do you suppose they have in America
	I dont know said the corporal Probably dogs as crazy as everything else they have And he went on Maybe dogs are no good anyway It might be just as well if we never bothered with them except for police work
	It might be said the soldier Ive heard the Leader doesnt like dogs Ive heard they make him itch and sneeze
	You hear all kinds of things the corporal said Listen The patrol stopped and from a great distance came the bee hum of planes
	There they come the corporal said Well there arent any lights Its been two weeks hasnt it since they came before
	Twelve days said the soldier
	The guards at the mine heard the high drone of the planes Theyre flying high a sergeant said And Captain Loft tilted his head back so that he could see under the rim of his helmet I judge over 20000 feet he said Maybe theyre going on over
	Arent very manyThe sergeant listened I dont think there are more than three of them Shall I call the battery
	Just see theyre alert and then call Colonel Lanserno dont call him Maybe they arent coming here Theyre nearly over and they havent started to dive yet
	Sounds to me like theyre circling I dont think there are more than two the sergeant said
	In their beds the people heard the planes and they squirmed deep intotheir featherbeds and listened In the palace of the Mayor the little sound awakened Colonel Lanser and he turned over on his back and looked at the dark ceiling with wideopen eyes and he held his breath to listen better and then his heart beat so that he could not hear as well as he could when he was breathing Mayor Orden heard the planes in his sleep and they made a dream for him and he moved and whispered in his sleep
	High in the air the two bombers circled mudcolored planes They cut their throttles and soared circling
	And from the belly of each one tiny littleobjects dropped hundreds of them one after another They plummeted a few feet and then little parachutes opened and drifted small packages silently and slowly downward toward the earth and the planes raised their throttles and gained altitude and then cut their throttles and circled again and more of the little objects plummeted down and then the planes turned and flew back in the direction from which they had come
	The tiny parachutes floated like thistledown and the breeze spread them out and distributed them as seeds on the ends of thistledown are distributed They drifted so slowly and landed so gently that sometimes the teninch packages of dynamite stood upright in the snow and the little parachutes folded gently down around them They looked black against the snow They landed in the white fields and among the woods of the hills and they landed in trees and hung down from the branches Some of them landed on the housetops of the little town some in the small front yards and one landed and stood upright in the snow crown on top of the head of the village statue of St Albert the Missionary
	One of the little parachutes came down in the street ahead of the patrol and the sergeant said Careful
	Its a time bomb
	It aint big enough a soldier said
	Well dont go near it The sergeant had his flashlight out and he turned it on the object a little parachute no bigger than a handkerchief colored light blue and hanging from it a package wrapped in blue paper
	Nowdont anybody touch it the sergeant said Harry you go down to the mine and get the captain
	Well keep an eye on this damn thing
	The late dawn came and the people moving out of their houses in the country saw the spots of blue against the snow They went to them and picked them up Theyunwrapped the paper and read the printed words They saw the gift and suddenly each finder grew furtive and he concealed the long tube under his coat and went to some secret place and hid the tube
	And word got to the children about the gift and they combed the countryside in a terrible Easter egg hunt and when some lucky child saw the blue color he rushed to the prize and opened it and then he hid the tube and told his parents about it There were some people who were frightened who turned the tubes over to the military but they were not very many And the soldiers scurried about the town in another Easter egg hunt but they were notso good at it as the children were
	In the drawingroom of the palace of the Mayor the diningtable remained with the chairs about as it had been placed the day Alex Morden was shot The room had not the grace it had when it was still the palace of the Mayor The walls bare of standing chairs looked very blank The table with a few papers scattered about on it made the room look like a business office The clock on the mantel struck nine It was a dark day now overcast with clouds for the dawn had brought the heavy snow clouds
	Annie came out of the Mayors room she swooped by the table and glanced at the papers that lay there
	Captain Loft came in He stopped in the doorway seeing Annie
	What are you doing here he demanded
	And Annie said sullenly Yes sir
	I said what are you doing here
	I thought to clean up sir
	Let things alone and go along
	And Annie said Yes sir and she waited until he was clear of the door and she scuttled out
	Captain Loft turned back through the doorway and he said All right bring it in A soldier came through the door behind him his rifle hung over his shoulder by a strap and in his arms he held a number of the blue packages and from the ends of the packages there dangled the little strings and pieces of blue cloth
	Loft said Put them on the table The soldier gingerly laid the packages down Now go upstairs and report to Colonel Lanser that Im here with thethings and the soldier wheeled about and left the room
	Loft went to the table and picked up one of the packages and his face wore a look of distaste He held up the little blue cloth parachute held it above his head and dropped it and the cloth opened and the package floated to the floor He picked up the package again and examined it
	Now Colonel Lanser came quickly into the room followed by Major Hunter Hunter was carrying a square of yellow paper in his hand Lanser said Good morning Captain and he went to the head of the table and sat down For a moment he looked at the little pile of tubes and then he picked one up and held it in his hand Sit down Hunter he said Have you examined these
	Hunter pulled out a chair and sat down He looked at the yellow paper in his hand Not very carefully he said There are three breaks in the railroad all within ten miles
	Well take a look at them and see what you think Lanser said
	Hunter reached for a tube and stripped off the outer covering and inside was a small package next to the tube Hunter took out a knife and cut into the tube Captain Loft looked over his shoulder Then Hunter smelled the cut and rubbed his fingers together and he said Its silly Its commercial dynamite I dont know what per cent of nitroglycerin until I test it He looked at the end It has a regular dynamite cap fulminate of mercury and a fuseabout a minute I suppose He tossed the tube back onto the table Its very cheap and very simple he said
	The colonel looked at Loft How many do you think were dropped
	I dont know sir said Loft We picked up about fifty of them and about ninety parachutes they came in For some reason the people leave the parachutes when they take the tubes and then there are probably a lot we havent found yet
	Lanser waved his hand It doesnt really matter he said They can drop as many as they want We cant stop it and we cant use it against them either They havent conquered anybody
	Loft said fiercely We can beat them off the face of the earth
	Hunter was prying the copper cap out of the top of one of the sticks and Lanser said Yeswe can do that Have you looked at this wrapper Hunter
	Not yet I havent had time
	Its kind of devilish this thing said Colonel Lanser The wrapper is blue so that its easy to see
	Unwrap the outer paper and herehe picked up the small packagehere is a piece of chocolate
	Everybody will be looking for it Ill bet our own soldiers steal the chocolate Why the kids will be looking for them like Easter eggs
	A soldier came in and laid a square of yellow paper in front of the colonel and retired and Lanser glanced at it and laughed harshly Heres something for you Hunter Two more breaks in your line
	Hunter looked up from the copper cap he was examining and he asked How general is this Did they drop them everywhere
	Lanser was puzzled Now thats the funny thing Ive talked to the capital This is the only place theyve dropped them
	What do you make of that Hunter asked Well its hard to say I think this is a test place I suppose if it works here theyll use it all over and if it doesnt work here they wont bother
	What are you going to do Hunter asked
	The capital orders me to stamp this out so ruthlessly that they wont drop it any place else
	Hunter said plaintively How am I going to mend five breaks in the railroad I havent rails right now for five breaks
	Youll have to rip out some of the old sidings I guess said Lanser
	Hunter said Thatll make a hell of a roadbed
	Well anyway it will make a roadbed
	Major Hunter tossed the tube he had torn apart onto the pile and Loft broke in We must stop this thing at once sir We must arrest and punish people who picked these things up before they use them
	We have to get busy so these people wont think we are weak
	Lanser was smiling at him and he said Take it easy Captain Lets see what we have first and then well think of remedies
	He took a new package from the pile andunwrapped it He took the little piece of chocolate tasted it and he said This is a devilish thing Its good chocolate too I cant even resist it myself The prize in the grabbag Then he picked up the dynamite What do you think of this really Hunter
	What I told you Its very cheap and very effective for small jobs dynamite with a cap and a oneminute fuse Its good if you know how to use it Its no good if you dont
	Lanser studied the print on the inside of the wrapper Have you read this
	Glanced at it said Hunter
	Well I have read it and I want you to listen to it carefully said Lanser He read from the paper To the unconquered people Hide this Do not expose yourself You will need this later It is a present from your friends to you and from you to the invader of your country Do not try to do large things with it 
	He began to skip through the bill Now here rails in the country And work at night And tie up transportation Now here Instructions rails Place stick under rail close to the joint and tight against a tie Pack mud or hardbeaten snow around it so that it is firm When the fuse is lighted you have a slow count of sixty before it explodes
	He looked up at Hunter and Hunter said simply It works Lanser looked back at his paper and he skipped through Bridges Weaken do not destroy here transmission poles and here culverts trucks  He laid the blue handbill down Well there it is
	Loft said angrily We must do something There must be a way to control this What does headquarters say
	Lanser pursed his lips and his fingers played with one of the tubes I could have told you what theyd say before they said it I have the orders Set booby traps and poison the chocolate  He paused for a moment and then he said Hunter Im a good loyal man but sometimes when I hear the brilliant ideas of headquarters I wish I were a civilian an old crippled civilian They always think they are dealing with stupid people I dont say that this is a measure of their intelligence do I
	Hunter looked amused Do you
	Lanser said sharply No I dont But what will happen One man will pick up one of these and get blown to bits by our booby trap One kid will eat chocolate and die of strychnine poisoning And then
	He looked down at his hands They will poke them with poles or lasso them before they touch them
	They will try the chocolate on the cat Goddamn it Major these are intelligent people Stupid traps wont catch them twice
	Loft cleared his throat Sir this is defeatist talk he said We must do something Why do you suppose it was only dropped here sir
	And Lanser said For one of two reasons either this town was picked at random or else there is communication between this town and the outside We know that some of the young men have got away
	Loft repeated dully We must do something sir
	Now Lanser turned on him Loft I think Ill recommend you for the General Staff You want to get to work before you even know what the problem is This is a new kind of conquest Always before it was possible to disarm a people and keep them in ignorance Now they listen to their radios and we cant stop them We cant even find their radios
	A soldier looked in through the doorwayMr Corell to see you sir
	Lanser replied Tell him to wait He continued to talk to Loft They read the handbills weapons drop from the sky for them Now its dynamite Captain Pretty soon it may be grenades and then poison
	Loft said anxiously They havent dropped poison yet
	No but they will Can you think what will happen to the morale of our men or even to you if the people had some of those little game darts you know those silly little things you throw at a target the points coated perhaps with cyanide silent deadly little things that you couldnt hear coming that would pierce the uniform and make no noise And what if our men knew that arsenic was about Would you or they drink or eat comfortably
	Hunter said dryly Are you writing the enemys campaign Colonel 
	No Im trying to anticipate it 
	Loft said Sir we sit here talking when we should be searching for this dynamite If there is organization among these people we have to findit we have to stamp it out 
	Yes said Lanser we have to stamp it out ferociously I suppose You take a detail Loft Get Prackle to take one I wish we had more junior officers Tonders getting killed didnt help us a bit Why couldnt he let women alone 
	Loft said I dont like the way Lieutenant Prackle is acting sir 
	Whats he doing 
	He isnt doing anything but hes jumpy and hes gloomy 
	Yes Lanser said I know Its a thing Ive talked about so much You know he said I might be a majorgeneral if I hadnt talked about it so much We trained our young men for victory and youve got to admit theyre glorious in victory but they dont quite know how to act in defeat We told them they were brighter and braver than other young men It was a kind of shock to them to find out that they arent a bit braver or brighter than other young men
	Loft said harshly What do you mean by defeat We are not defeated
	And Lanser looked coldly up at him for a long moment and did not speak and finally Lofts eyes wavered and he said Sir
	Thank you said Lanser
	You dont demand it of the others sir
	They dont think about it so it isnt an insult When you leave it out its insulting
	Yes sir said Loft
	Goon now try to keep Prackle in hand Start your search I dont want any shooting unless theres an overt act do you understand 
	Yes sir said Loft and he saluted formally and went out of the room
	Hunter regarded Colonel Lanser amusedly Werent you rough on him 
	I had to be Hes frightened I know his kind He has to be disciplined when hes afraid or hell go to pieces He relies on discipline the way other men rely on sympathy I suppose youd better get to your rails You might as well expect that tonight is the time when theyll really blow them though 
	Hunter stood up and he said Yes I suppose the orders are coming in from the capital 
	Yes 
	Are they
	You know what they are Lanser interrupted You know what theyd have to be Take the leaders shoot the leaders take hostages shoot the hostages take more hostages shoot themhis voice had risen but now it sank almost to a whisperand the hatred growing and the hurt between us deeper and deeper
	Hunter hesitated Have they condemned any from the list of names and he motioned slightly toward the Mayors bedroom
	Lanser shook his headNo not yet They are just arrested so far 
	Hunter said quietly Colonel do you want me to recommendmaybe youre overtired Colonel
	Could Iyou knowcould I report that youre overtired 
	For a moment Lanser covered his eyes with his hand and then his shoulders straightened and his face grew hard Im not a civilian Hunter Were short enough of officers already You know that Get to your work Major I have to see Corell
	Hunter smiled He went to the door and opened it and he said out of the door Yes hes here and over his shoulder he said to Lanser Its Prackle He wants to see you 
	Send him in said Lanser
	Prackle came in his face sullen belligerent Colonel Lanser sir I wish to 
	Sit down said Lanser Sit down and rest a moment Be a good soldier Lieutenant 
	The stiffness went out of Prackle quickly He sat down beside the table and rested his elbows on it 
	I wish 
	And Lanser said Dont talk for a moment I know what it is You didnt think it would be this way did you You thought it would be rather nice 
	They hate us Prackle said They hate us so much 
	Lanser smiled I wonder if I know what it is It takes young men to make good soldiers and young men need young women is that it
	Yes thats it
	Well Lanser said kindly does she hate you
	Prackle looked at him in amazement I dont know sir Sometimes I think shes only sorry
	And youre pretty miserable
	I dont like it here sir
	No you thought it would be fun didnt you Lieutenant Tonder went to pieces and then he went out and they got a knife in him I could send you home Do you want to be sent home knowing we need you here
	Prackle said uneasily No sir I dont
	Good Now Ill tell you and I hope youll understand it Youre not a man any more You are a soldier Your comfort is of no importance and Lieutenant your life isnt of much importance If you live you will have memories Thats about all you will have Meanwhile you must take orders and carry them out Most of the orders will be unpleasant but thats not your business I will not lie to you Lieutenant
	They should have trained you for this and not for flowerstrewn streets They should have built your soul with truth not led it along with lies His voice grew hard But you took the job Lieutenant Will you stay with it or quit it We cant take care of your soul
	Prackle stood up Thank you sir
	And the girl Lanser continued the girl Lieutenant you may rape her or protect her or marry herthat is of no importance so long as you shoot her when it is ordered
	Prackle said wearily Yes sir thank you sir
	I assure you it is better to know I assure you of that It is better to know Go now Lieutenant and if Corell is still waiting send him in And he watched Lieutenant Prackle out of the doorway
	When Mr Corell came in he was a changed man His left arm was in a cast and he was no longer the jovial friendly smiling Corell His face was sharp and bitter and his eyes squinted down like little dead pigs eyes
	I should have come before Colonel he said but your lack of cooperation made me hesitant
	Lanser said You were waiting for a reply to your report I remember
	I was waiting for much more than that You refused me a position of authority You said I was valueless You did not realize that I was in this town long before you were You left the Mayor in his office contrary to my advice
	Lanser said Without him here we might have had much more disorder than we have
	That is a matter of opinion Corell said This man is a leader of a rebellious people
	Nonsense said Lanser hes just a simple man With his good hand Corell took a black notebook from his right pocket and opened it with his fingers You forgot Colonel that I had mysources that I had been here a long time before you I have to report to you that Mayor Orden has been in constant contact with every happening in this community On the night when Lieutenant Tonder was murdered he was in the house where the murder was committed When the girl escaped to the hills she stayed with one of his relatives I traced her there but she was gone Whenever men have escaped Orden has known about it and has helped them And I even strongly suspect that he is somewhere in the picture of these little parachutes
	Lanser said eagerly But you cant prove it
	No Corell said I cant prove it The first thing I know the last I only suspect Perhaps now you will be willing to listen to me
	Lanser said quietly What do you suggest
	These suggestions Colonel are a little stronger than suggestions Orden must now be a hostage and his life must depend on the peacefulness of this community His life must depend on the lighting of one single fuse on one single stick of dynamite
	He reached into his pocket again and brought out a little folding book and he flipped it open and laid it in front of the colonel This sir was the answer to my report from headquarters You will notice that it gives me certain authority
	Lanser looked at the little book and he spoke quietly You really did go over my head didnt you He looked up at Corell with frank dislike in his eyes I heard youd been injured How did it happen
	Corell said On the night when your lieutenant was murdered I was waylaid The patrol saved me
	Some of the townsmen escaped in my boat that night Now Colonel must I express more strongly than I have that Mayor Orden must be held hostage
	Lanser said He is here he hasnt escaped How can we hold him more hostage than we are
	Suddenly in the distance there was a sound of an explosion and both men looked around in the direction from which it came Corell said There it is Colonel and you know perfectly well that if this experiment succeeds there will be dynamite in every invaded country
	Lanser repeated quietly What do you suggest
	Just what I have said Orden must be held against rebellion
	And if they rebel and we shoot Orden
	Then that little doctor is next although he holds no position hes next in authority in the town
	But he holds no office
	He has the confidence of the people
	And when we shoot him what then
	Then we have authority Then rebellion will be broken When we have killed the leaders the rebellion will be broken
	Lanser asked quizzically Do you really think so
	It must be so
	Lanser shook his head slowly and then he called Sentry The door opened and a soldier appeared in the doorway Sergeant said Lanser I have placed Mayor Orden under arrest and I have placed Doctor Winter under arrest You will see to it that Orden is guarded and you will bring Winter here immediately
	The sentry said Yes sir
	Lanser looked up at Corell and he said You know I hope you know what youre doing I do hope you know what youre doing



CHAPTER VIII

In the little town the news ran quickly It was communicated by whispers in doorways by quick meaningful looksThe Mayors been arrestedand through the town a little quiet jubilance ran a fierce little jubilance and people talked quietly together and went apart and people going in to buy food leaned close to the clerks for a moment and a word passed between them
	The people went into the country into the woods searching for dynamite And children playing in the snow found the dynamite and by now even the children had their instructions They opened the packages and ate the chocolate and then they buried the dynamite in the snow and told their parents where it was
	Far out in the country a man picked up a tube and read the instructions and he said to himself I wonder if this works He stood the tube up in the snow and lighted the fuse and he ran back from it and counted but his count was fast It was sixtyeight before the dynamite exploded He said It does work and he went hurriedly about looking for more tubes
	Almost as though at a signal the people went into their houses and the doors were closed the streets were quiet At the mine the soldiers carefully searched every miner who went into the shaft searched and researched and the soldiers were nervous and rough and they spoke harshly to the miners The miners looked coldly at them and behind their eyes was a little fierce jubilance
	In the drawingroom of the palace of the Mayor the table had been cleaned up and a soldier stood guard at Mayor Ordens bedroom door Annie was on her knees in front of the coal grate putting little pieces of coal on the fire She looked up at the sentry standing in front of Mayor Ordens door and she said truculently Well what are you doing to do to him The soldier did not answer
	The outside door opened and another soldier came in holding Doctor Winter by the arm He closed the door behind Doctor Winter and stood against the door inside the room Doctor Winter said Hello Annie hows His Excellency
	And Annie pointed at the bedroom and said Hes in there
	He isnt ill Doctor Winter said
	No he didnt seem to be said Annie Ill see if I can tell him youre here She went to the sentry and spoke imperiously Tell His Excellency that Doctor Winter is here do you hear me
	The sentry did not answer and did not move but behind him the door opened and Mayor Orden stood in the doorway He ignored the sentry and brushed past him and stepped into the room For a moment the sentry considered taking him back and then he returned to his place beside the door Orden said Thank you Annie Dont go too far away will you I might need you
	Annie said No sir I wont Is Madame all right
	Shes doing her hair Do you want to see her Annie
	Yes sir said Annie and she brushed past the sentry too and went into the bedroom and shut the door Orden said Is there something you want Doctor
	Winter grinned sardonically and pointed over his shoulder to his guard Well I guess Im under arrest
	My friend here brought me
	Orden said I suppose it was bound to come What will they do now I wonder And the two men looked at each other for a long time and each one knew what the other was thinking
	And then Orden continued as though he had been talking You know I couldnt stop it if I wanted to
	I know said Winter but they dont know And he went on with a thought he had been having A timeminded people he said and the time is nearly up They think that just because they have only one leader and one head we are all like that They know that ten heads lopped off will destroy them but we are a free people we have as many heads as we have people and in a time of need leaders pop up among us like mushrooms
	Orden put his hand on Winters shoulder and he said Thank you I knew it but its good to hear you say it The little people wont go under will they He searched Winters face anxiously
	And the doctor reassured him Why no they wont As a matter of fact they will grow stronger with outside help
	The room was silent for a moment The sentry shifted his position a little and his rifle clinked on a button
	Orden said I can talk to you Doctor and I probably wont be able to talk again There are little shameful things in my mind He coughed and glanced at the rigid soldier but the soldier gave no sign of having heard I have been thinking of my own death If they follow the usual course they must kill me and then they must kill you And when Winter was silent he said Mustnt they
	Yes I guess so Winter walked to one of the gilt chairs and as he was about to sit down he noticed that its tapestry was torn and he petted the seat with his fingers as though that would mend it And he sat down gently because it was torn
	And Orden went on You know Im afraid I have been thinking of ways to escape to get out of it I have been thinking of running away I have been thinking of pleading for my life and it makes me ashamed
	And Winter looking up said But you havent done it
	No I havent
	And you wont do it
	Orden hesitated No I wont But I have thought of it
	And Winter said gently How do you know everyone doesnt think of it How do you know I havent thought of it
	I wonder why they arrested you too Orden said I guess they will have to kill you too
	I guess so said Winter He rolled his thumbs and watched them tumble over and over
	You know so Orden was silent for a moment and then he said You know Doctor I am a little man and this is a little town but there must be a spark in little men that can burst into flame I am afraid I am terribly afraid and I thought of all the things I might do to save my own life and then that went away and sometimes now I feel a kind of exultation as though I were bigger and better than I am and do you know what I have been thinking Doctor He smiled remembering Do you remember in school in the Apology Do you remember Socrates says Someonewill say And are you not ashamed Socrates of a course of life which is likely to bring you to an untimely end To him I may fairly answer There you are mistaken a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying he ought only to consider whether he is doing right or wrong   Orden paused trying to remember
	Doctor Winter sat tensely forward now and he went on with it Acting the part of a good man or of a bad I dont think you have it quite right You never were a good scholar You were wrong in the denunciation too
	Orden chuckled Do you remember that
	Yes said Winter eagerly I remember it well You forgot a line or a word It was graduation and you were so excited you forgot to tuck in your shirttail and your shirttail was out You wondered why they laughed
	Orden smiled to himself and his hand went secretly behind him and patrolled for a loose shirttail I was Socrates he said and I denounced the School Board How I denounced them I bellowed it and I could see them grow red
	Winter said They were holding their breaths to keep from laughing Your shirttail was out
	Mayor Orden laughedHow long ago Forty years
	Fortysix
	The sentry by the bedroom door moved quietly over to the sentry by the outside door They spoke softly out of the corners of their mouths like children whispering in school How long you been on duty
	All night Cant hardly keep my eyes open
	Me too Hear from your wife on the boat yesterday 
	Yes She said say hello to you Said she heard youwas wounded She dont write much 
	Tell her Im all right 
	Surewhen I write 
	The Mayor raised his head and looked at the ceiling and he muttered Umumum I wonder if I can rememberhow does itgo 
	And Winter prompted him And now O men 
	And Orden said softly And now O men who have condemned me 
	Colonel Lanser came quietly into the room the sentries stiffened Hearing the words the colonel stopped and listened
	Orden looked at the ceiling lost in trying to remember the old words And now O men who have condemned me  he said  I would fain prophesy to youfor I am about to dieandin the hour of deathmen are gifted with prophetic power And Iprophesy to you who are my murderersthat immediately after mymy death 
	And Winter stood up saying Departure 
	Orden looked at him What
	And Winter said The word is departure not death You made the same mistake before You made that mistake fortysix years ago
	No it is death It is death Orden looked around and saw Colonel Lanser watching him He asked Isnt it death
	Colonel Lanser said Departure It is immediately after my departure 
	Doctor Winter insisted You see thats two against one Departure is the word It is the same mistake you made before
	Then Orden looked straight ahead and his eyes were in his memory seeing nothing outward And he went on I prophesy to you who are my murderers that immediately after mydeparture punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you 
	Winter nodded encouragingly and Colonel Lanser nodded and they seemed to be trying to help him to remember And Orden went on Me you have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser and not to give an account of your lives 
	Lieutenant Prackle entered excitedly crying Colonel Lanser 
	Colonel Lanser said Shh and he held out his hand to restrain him
	And Orden went on softly But that will not be as you suppose far otherwise  His voice grew stronger  For I say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now he made a little gesture with his hand a speechmaking gesture accuserswhom hitherto I have restrained and as they are younger they will be more inconsiderate with you and you will be more offended at them  He frowned trying to remember
	And Lieutenant Prackle said Colonel Lanser we have found some men with dynamite 
	And Lanser said Hush 
	Orden continued If you think that by killing men you can prevent someone from censuring your evil lives you are mistaken  He frowned and thought and he looked at the ceiling and he smiled embarrassedly and he said Thats all I can remember It is gone away from me
	And Doctor Winter said Its very good after fortysix years and you werent very good at it fortysix years ago
	Lieutenant Prackle broke in The men have dynamite Colonel Lanser 
	Did you arrest them 
	Yes sir Captain Loft and 
	Lanser said Tell Captain Loft to guard them He recaptured himself and he advanced into the room and he said Orden these things must stop 
	And the Mayor smiled helplessly at him They cannot stop sir 
	Colonel Lanser said harshly I arrested you as a hostage for the good behavior of your people Those are my orders 
	But that wont stop it Orden said simply You dont understand When I have become a hindrance to the people they will do without me
	Lanser said Tell me truly what you think If the people know you will be shot if they light another fuse what will they do
	The Mayor looked helplessly at Doctor Winter And then the bedroom door opened and Madame came out carrying the Mayors chain of office in her hand She said You forgot this
	Orden said What Oh yes and he stooped his head and Madame slipped the chain of office over his head and he said Thank you dear
	Madame complained youalways forget it You forget it all the time
	The Mayor looked at the end of the chain he held in his handthe gold medallion with the insignia of his office carved on it Lanser pressed him What will they do
	I dont know said the Mayor I think they will light the fuse
	Suppose you ask them not to
	Winter said Colonel this morning I saw a little boy building a snow man while three grown soldiers watched to see that he did not caricature your leader He made a pretty good likeness too before they destroyed it
	Lanser ignored the doctor Suppose you ask them not to he repeated
	Orden seemed half asleep his eyes were drooped and he tried to think He said I am not a very brave man sir I think they will light it anyway He struggled with his speech I hope they will but if I ask them not to they will be sorry
	Madame said What is this all about
	Be quiet a moment dear the Mayor said
	But you think they will light it Lanser insisted
	The Mayor spoke proudly Yes they will light it I have no choice of living or dying you see sir butI do have a choice of how I do it If I tell them not to fight they will be sorry but they will fight If I tell them to fight they will be glad and I who am not a very brave man will have made them a little braver
	He smiled apologetically You see it is an easy thing to do since the end for me is the same
	Lanser said If you say yes we can tell them you said no We can tell them you begged for your life
	And Winter broke in angrily They would know You do not keep secrets One of your men got out of hand one night and he said the flies had conquered the flypaper and now the whole nation knows his words They have made a song of it The flies have conquered the flypaper You do not keep secrets Colonel
	From the direction of the mine a whistle tooted shrilly And a quick gust of wind sifted dry snow against the windows
	Orden fingered his gold medallion He said quietly You see sir nothing can change it You will be destroyed and driven out His voice was very soft The people dont like to be conquered sir and so they will not be Free men cannot start a war but once it is started they can fight on in defeat Herd men followers of a leader cannot do that and so it is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars You will find that is so sir
	Lanser was erect and stiff My orders are clear Eleven oclock was the deadline I have taken hostages If there is violence the hostages will be executed
	And Doctor Winter said to the colonel Will you carry out the orders knowing they will fail
	Lansers face was tight I will carry out my orders no matter what they are but I do think sir a proclamation from you might save many lives
	Madame broke in plaintively I wish you would tell me what all this nonsense is
	It is nonsense dear
	But they cant arrest the Mayor she explained to him
	Orden smiled at her No he said they cant arrest the Mayor The Mayor is an idea conceived by free men It will escape arrest
	From the distance there was a sound of an explosion And the echo of it rolled to the hills and back again The whistle at the coal mine tooted a shrill sharp warning Orden stood very tensely for a moment and then he smiled A second explosion roarednearer this time and heavierand its echo rolled back from the mountains Orden looked at his watch and then he took his watch and chain and put them in Doctor Winters hand How did it go about the flies he asked
	The flies have conquered the flypaperWinter said
	Orden called Annie The bedroom door opened instantly and the Mayor said Were you listening
	Yes sir Annie was embarrassed
	And now an explosion roared near by and there was a sound of splintering wood and breaking glass and the door behind the sentries puffed open And Orden said Annie I want you to stay with Madame as long as she needs you Dont leave her alone He put his arm around Madame and he kissed her on the forehead and then he moved slowly toward the door where Lieutenant Prackle stood In the doorway he turned back to Doctor Winter Crito I owe a cock to Asclepius he said tenderly Will you remember to pay the debt
	Winter closed his eyes for a moment before he answered The debt shall be paid
	Orden chuckled then I remembered that one I didnt forget that one He put his hand on Prackles arm and the lieutenant flinched away from him
	And Winter nodded slowly Yes you remembered The debt shall be paid
